GDP v/s GVA

--The Gross Value Added (GVA) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) give a picture of economic activity 

from producers (supply side) and consumers (demand side) perspectives respectively.
--GDP is essentially GVA plus net indirect taxes [NIA] (indirect taxes minus subsidies) 
- divergence due to presence of Net Indirect Taxes ( NIT= indirect taxes-subsidies) which are 

accounted in GDP at market price calculations (GDP is sum of GVA and NIT). 
-GDP when comaring to world (ie. eco overall picture) ,GVA to measure sectoral performance.

GVA is better  because.
- A sector-wise breakdown provided by the GVA measure can better help the policymakers to decide 

which sectors need incentives/ stimulus or vice versa.
-better productivity of the producers as it excludes the indirect taxes .However, it can also be 

argued that GVA is distorted due to presence of subsidies.
-GDP can increase when inflation goes up or taxes goes up without actually increasing output not so 

with GVA
