Coal

recent trend in production
-Recently, coal production in India has gone up, though not enough to meet India's full demand. 
-Another rising complication in the situation is that State utilities companies are increasingly facing financial problems, thus though there is demand for coal, the State power utility cos. are unable to buy Indian coal.

Measures that have been taken by the government are as follows:
- Coal block auction has been dramatically changed. Not only has the mode of auction changed, but there is talk of allowing coal production for the market (as opposed to only for use by other factories of the same entity).
- The govt. cognizant of the shortage of Indian coal, has often been preferential to coal-mining, even when there are other competing concerns, such as environmental issues or welfare of local communities

However, there are a few things that could be done to improve the situation further:
- Research into clearner and efficent 
- Improve finances of State utility cos. As mentioned before, the reduced capability of state utility cos. has a direct impact on the demand side of the coal market.

petrolium /crude oil
- obtained from sedimentary rocks

how it was formed
-animal plan fell into see and covered by mud
-mud turned into rock and exterted pressure , nearby rocks also generated heat so both pressure and heat
-was important that no air or oxygen was present.

-import of petrolium is concern, in 14-15 it was more than 7 lakh crore

Recent step taken by govt
-taken for 69 small and marginal oilfields lying with the state-owned exploration agencies
-cabinet sanction auction and distribution to private and foreign firm for exploration
-new approach in the licensing and proceeds-sharing 
-instead of profit sharing govt approved revenue sharing , as profit sharing need govt to calculate cost of exploration,machines etc which dealy the process
-firm can sell at market price ,no intervention from govt
-revenue and royality to govt @ market price,if sell below market then also at market price , if sell above market price than at that price. so win win for govt
-till now firm require separate licence to explore every hydrocarbon.now single licence for both conventional (oil gas) and non conventional (shale gas and shale oil) -> also ease of doing business


Limitation
-This done only for 69 small oil fields ,should be extended to all.

->Why so much oil in middle east and not in India
-1)sedimentation occurred between 30 degree north and south were temperature was high and organic activity was high. Middle east lied between these range(while in Godwana land) where India missed it.
2)Middle east was at favorable position during mid cretaceous Global warming, coupled with sea level rise and abundance of plankton
3)500 million years history of sedimentation on continental margins of Gondwana.
-continental shelf is also a important reason...middle east continental shelf was larger in size in comparison Indian shelf in the era of tethis sea.large continent shelf implies for floura and fauna -> More oil and petrolium
4)though oil is formed in sedimentary rocks but all sedimentary rocks do not contain oil. An oil reseroviour must have three pre-requisite conditions--
(A) porosity-to accumulate large amount of oil. (middle east rocks are formed of limestone and dolomite which have high porosity. Indian rocks are hard and not so porous) 
(B) Permeability to discharge oil and gas when oil is drilled (dolomite and limestone has high permeability).
(C) porous sand beds, sandstone should be capped by impervious bed so that oil do not dissipate to surrounding rocks.
All these conditions are favorable in middle east and not in India.So India is a energy (petroleum) deficit country.



Does Cast still relevant in Indian Dispora
-It is oftenly said that Globalization and eco prosperity has inverse relation with Caste rigidity. 
-It has some effect on disporta like untouchability not there , other social gathering like having dinner together , attending event together etc has evolved
-But cast still prevalent in various forms
-Marriage within same caste
-Preference for Brahman for religious ceremony and heading temple affairs
-religious sermons, charity and fundraising drives among the community are conducted by appointed preachers of the caste
-Dress code are adhered too.
-People change their names and surnames to get away from low-caste identity.

But caste consciousness is not so rigid in indian Diaspora as in india



Govt non efficent early retirement notice
-it envisage compulsory retirement for non-performing officials
-circular ask department to assess senior officials performance , If found lacking in any way, especially in the matter of integrity—officialese for corruption— the DoPT, which is headed by the Prime Minister, will “compulsorily retire” the official “for the sake of public interest,” says the circular.
-DoPT order is actually an old provision in the service rule which was meant to weed out non-performers
-August last year, the government amended the All India Service (conduct) Rules, 1968, to unveil a 19-point guideline for bureaucrats. The need for political neutrality was one of the points listed.

->Pro
-Fear of action will urge them to work efficently -> More productivity
-Will induce professionalism
-Will encourage merit and will inspire young officer to work hard


->Against
-Fear of action might lead to action in haste which might not been properly analyzed
-applicable only to officials who have either completed 30 years in service or reached 50 years of age
-Politicization can happen , can be used as a weapon to handle good people. Example -Ashok Khemka and Durga shakti Nagpal suspension when she tried to stop illegal sand mining.
-In case of very frequent transfers it might be very difficult to asess performance.

Removing the deadwood from the system and giving a clear message to non performing officials (shape up or sit out)is important to take country forward but any such move should be carefully analyzed by parliament and civil society.


Govt food scheme critical analyse

Answer: these are the major food policies of the government with their implementation and performance :

->Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS): 
1.the only scheme that deals with malnutrition of children between 0-6 years on such a large scale 
2. Targets proper nutrition to adolescent girls, pregnant women and nursing mothers

Performance : have led to reduced deaths of children due to malnutritional diseases.

Implementation problems :
1. Very little coverage and highly irregular supply of supplementary nutrition 
2. Exclusion of backward classes 
3.limited number of beneficiaries can be accommodated in an anganwadis
4.several sanctioned ICDS projects out of operation 
5. Misplaced focus : focus not really on the age group 0-2 yrs but on 2-6 yrs 
6.personnels poorly trained and not given requisite skills 
7. Poor infrastructure and inventory 
8. Restricted or no community participation 
9. Poor coordination between ministry of health and ministry of women and children 
Best practices seen in tamil nadu

MID DAY MEAL 1995 : 
1. To boost universalisation of primary education 
2. Improve nutritional status of children between 6-14 yrs 
Benefits : improved nutrition with education and also broke caste and social barriers

Gaps : 
1. Does not cover children who don't come to school 
2. Food variety is an issue 
3. Poor infrastructure for kitchen , drinking water and utensils 
4. SHG excludes Sc/St 
5. Quality of food grains is an issue

SAMPOORNA GRAMEEN ROZGAR YOJNA : 
1. Provide additional wage employment for food security and nutritional level
2. Assets and infrastructure development in rural areas

Gaps: 
1. Not all (eg. Disabled or pregnant women ) can work in public construction work so employment opportunity needs to be widened 
2. Execution of work not efficient 
3. Crèches for working mothers have been made mandatory but rarely followed
4.no social audit.
5. No such provision for urban poor

TARGETED PDS:
Distribution of 35 kg grain per month to each bpl /aay household by state government

Gaps: 
1. Delay in identification 
2. Misidentification 
3. Less coverage of vulnerable categories 
4. Fair price shops inefficient in many ways
5. Allocation based on a very contentious poverty line
6. Leakages : severe diversion of food grains of 30-40%
Best practice in TN and andhra pradesh.

India and west secularism , is indian concept flawed w.r.t west secularism

Our concept of secularism is based on different interpretations:
1. Gandhiji's interpretation --"sarv dharm sambhav" --> he knew about the religiosity of Indian masses and that they would never go for complete seperation of state and religion.
2. Nehru's --> DHARM NISHPEKSHTA --> " religious neutrality" which we find in our constitution. WHY --> Nehru knew that religious identitieseasily gets converted into religious prejudices rather than sensibilities as MKG is thinking. --> evokes "dangerous political passion"--> so he talked about neutrality.
3. Ambedkar's concept of "differentiated citizenships" for minorities--> which actually contradict the original idea of secularism i..e. "universal citizenship".


--both are different from each other. 
-this querstion raised by westeern scholar who failed to understand indian context of secularism and Dharam and Jati has played a significance role to shape it.

-Western concept is of Negative secularism which means complete detachment of State from religious matters & vice versa.
- Indian concept is called Positive secularism which means State will give equal patronage to every religion & won’t discriminate between religions.
-There are boundaries, of course b/w state and religion, but they are porous and state can and have intervned in the past.
This intervention can include granting aid to educational institutions of religious communities on a non-preferential basis, and interfering in socio-religious institutions that deny equal dignity like abolision of untouchability.
-it 0pens up the possibility of different societies working out their own secularisms. In short, it opens out the possibility of multiple secularisms.

- wrong to say either of the concepts is flawed because both were the result of prevailing socio-cultural situations on their contemporary societies.
-West was mostly a single religion society. There was no majority-minority conflict. In medieval times the Church controlled the land & political power too. 
-But after Enlightenment period the role of both got separated & mutually exclusive. This suited the western society.
-India on the other hand at the time of independence was a multi religious society with one religion being in majority. And due to divide & rule policy of British, other religions grew apprehensive of protection of their interests in free India
-. Hence Indian concept of secularism was born as provided in Preamble & Fundamental rights of Indian constitution which mandates the state to give equal protection to all religions & prohibits any discrimination based on religion. 
-Complete dissociation between state & religion might have led to conflicts between religion or marginalization of a particular religion.
-Hence we cannot say that Indian concept of secularism is flawed, its different to suit Indian society.

Section 124A 
-of the IPC spells out that if the words or signs by someone caused hatred, enmity, contempt or disloyality against the state government or intended to public disorder, then charges of sedition can be framed against that person.

Justification for repeal of the section 124A of the IPC is as follow :

#Against freedom of expression: Section 124A of the IPC clearly violates the freedom of speech & expression enshrined in the article 19(1) because in case of hatred, enmity,, disloyalty - even no reasonable restriction in article 19(2). Also, in case of contempt & public disorder, it is clearly mentioned that reasonable restriction should not be arbitrary & impairment of freedom should be as little as possible.

#Discretionary power to police : Scope of determining wheather person caused public disorder or hatred or is democratically protesting is to be determined by the police & because of wide discretion it is likely to get misused.
-recently, dismissal of sedition charges over cartoonist Aseem Trivedi by the Bombay HC reflect the same.

#Scope of freedom of expression : In home of the world's largest democracy, restricting freedom of speech & silencing the political dissenters fo mere fear or suspecion of serious injury is not justified. 
-Before 1947 the reason behind implementation of this section was to promote British exploitation and that the native intelligentsia may not be a hindrance in doing so
-some call punishment too harsh ,life imprisonment, 3 years imprisonment or fine....

In Favour:
#Court Decisions : Supreme court's decision to uphold freedom of expression & struck down the section 66A of IT act but validity of 124A was held by court.
-Section 124A is necessary as ,according to honourable Supreme Court's judgement of 1962 , it strikes correct balance between between fundamental rights on one hand and need for public order on other. Section 124A is also needed in diverse and still maturing country like India.
-Removal can be misued by radical people and organization.Like a Hydrabad politician openly spoke vemon aginst religion and state , later on as a case was filed he backtracked.(?)
-Used anti Indian Kashmiri separatist , if repealed they may have a free walk and speak venom against nation.

Suggestion
-Law should be cleary defined to sto any misuse
-case should be handled by senior police officers so that mis interpretation dont happen
-politician should behave maturely and dont use it as political and publicity tool.
