Manipur clashes
- inhabited by 3 communities majorly Meiteis( non tribal)in majority and kuki, naga(both tribal) in minority. 
-clash related to passing of Protection of Manipur Peoples bill, Manipur Land Revenue &Land Reforms(seventh amendment) bill and  -Manipur Shop &Establishment(second amendment) bill 
- The bills were passed on the demand of Meiteis to introduce ILP(inner line permit) to restrict in migration as they fear of being reduced to minority.
-ILP is currently in operation in Nagaland, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh. Under it outsider need pass or permit to travel within a state for a particular period of time.
- origin under british to protect their commercial interest in oil and tea in north east 
-after 1947 continue to protect tribal culture.
-discontinued in Assam in 1950(Manipur then was part of Assam).

reasons for clashes 
1. Kukis and nagas say Meiteis through reform want to have an access to hill areas inhabited by them 
2. as per kuku naga ILP can be used by Meitei community to declare them outsiders as bill provision very strict to declare as Manipuri.
3.Manipuri officially a non tribal state therefore demand for ILP is not justified on
constitutional basis 
4. Protection of Manipur People bill defines Manipur people as those whom name is enumerated in all three registers( National Register of Citizens 1951, Census report 1951 and Village Directory 1951) and their descendents. Thus exclusion of name from even one will disqualify a person to be termed as a Manipuri.
5. The Manipur was granted statehood in 1972, this means that those who came in state between 1951 and 1972 according to 3 registers will be termed as outsiders stripping them from benefits of state’s quota in government jobs, education etc
6. Experts feel that clashes are because of not properly explaining the bills to people. 
-In fact buying the land by outsider
has made more stringent(earlier only approval of a section of cabinet needed but now whole cabinet need to give approval) and also buying of land belonging to tribal by a non tribal needs approval of deputy commissioner concerned. Tribal areas are also not disturbed under new bills.
-AFPSA and  greater nagalim demand

decentralization under 6th schedule is solution.

-foreign law firms would recruit their best talents and this would leave domestic law firms vulnerable
-Small player will be badly effected
-domestic laws put a lot of restrictions on domestic law practitioners with regard to advertisement,partnerships,capital raising or employment in foreign law firms and hence unless there is a level playing field ,they would be at serious disadvantages

Land related

-Capitalisation with agri MNC
-public/private consolidation to develop infra like road,port,electricity
-small farmer face loss and sell land
-increasing corporate farming
-alternate source of employment so small farmer switching

-india's experience

-Might be hard to strike balance b/w industry right and right of the labourers
-India has long history of labour exploitation during British era. Fear of getting back there.
-Most of labour in unorg sector who might be well exploited in absence of safeguard due to low 
awareness level.

-

15 APril LAbour reforms add on [labour currently in concurrent list]

with meager work environment , wages , facilities and social security.
-Required to accelrate growth for poverty elimination
Objective
--Labour reforms include providing job security to the nation’s labour population, along
 with financial independence
Some steps by govt in past
-1. Regulating employment of contract labour along with those who are regularly employed.
2. Women permitted to work night shifts too, wherever they feel comfortable.
3. Payment of gratuity amount, if the labour retires or leaves.
4. Bonuses to be paid to the labourers from the profits earned from productivity.
5. Other reforms like the maternity benefits act, Indira Gandhi National Old Age scheme,
National pension scheme, changes in apprentice act, Atal pension yojna etc.
what else
-Labour should be shifted from concurrent to state list, so that each state can better 
cater to their labourers’ needs
-The numerous laws complicate their usage. So, they should be consolidated.govt planning to reduce from 44 to 5.four of the five laws will deal with wages, social security, industrial safety and welfare, and industrial relations.5th special law for smaller factories.
-The maintanence of records of workers in the companies, should be computerised,
 to avoid tempering later and easy access.


Krishi Vigyan Kendra
- frontline agricultural extension center funded by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)
-Focus on training and education of farmers,on field demonstration of new and improved farming techniques etc
-were set up to ensure a last mile linkage, which would provide farmers with information and training about scientific farming, mitigation measures in case of adverse climatic events, consultancy services regarding the type of crops to be sown, the type and amount of fertilizer to be used etc.
-
Less successfull reasons
-KVKs have different organisational structures.some under ICAR ,some under state agri university
-lack of penentration - one center in one district,not sufficent is district is large
-KVKs have had some impact by proving training and some advisory services, their mandate was very expansive which they have not been able to fulfill due to lack of budgetary support.
- KVKs do not have integration with the weather monitoring and forecasting services

-Regular adjournment and daly in verdict - fast track courts
-Not leveraging technologies : - use of video conference picking up slowly
-Independence from political control - SC collegium system judgement and NJAC
-Technical and costly nature - SC verdit on PIL enable common man to go to court

-Overloaded judiciary - setup of other quasi judicial bodies like NHRC which shed load from 
judiciary



IT ACT -66A
SC strike down section 66A of IT act[2000] saying it voilate Right to speech
-defines the punishment for sending “offensive” messages through a computer or any other
 communication device like a mobile phone or a tablet
-max 3 year in jail and fine
-Word Offensive is vague, can be perceived in many senses

-Has been used against a WB professor for forwarding a funny cartoon on Mamta
Aseem Trivedi for parliament cartoon

-example why required - bangalore exodus, ISIS social propaganda,Musaffarnagar riots

-SC Supreme court in Shreya Singhal Vs Union of India case scrapped 66A but upheld 69A stating that there are enough internal safeguards
Those safeguards are:
1.Intermediaries(those who host articles like Google, facebook etc) have to be given a chance to be heard as a right.
2. If the original originator of a particular article is found, he/she also must be given a hearing.
3. Above two can be circumvented if a court itself passes a order to block websites or URL's.

problems
-But the lack of transparency in process

IT Act 2000 w.r.t cyber threats
-Amended time to time to take care of cyberthreats.Below provisions
-Section 70A estab of a special agency to form norms and guidelines to ensure safety of Critical Information Infrastructure (CII). includes 12 sectors like banking, defense, aviation etc.
2. Section 70B estab of an 'Indian Computer Emergency Team' (CERT-IN) modeled on a similar force in USA. will lead with hacking ,phising ,strength our internet domain and other cyber threats
3. However, the bill is weak on data protection. The bill has provisions for against wrongful loss or wrongful gain but does not protect the privacy. Hence, it does not prevent companies from selling or sharing consumer data with others.
4. the bill also does not define cyber terrorism, nor has any provisions against the same.
5. Issues like spam, child pornography etc are also not adequately tackled by the bill.
->Other issues
-chaning nature of field , govt is left behind
-tardy implementation
-Abusive use of certain provisions like 66A which SC scrapped recently.

-Inter state water dispute.
Article 262 of the Constitution lays down that the Parliament may by law provide for the adjudication of any dispute with respect to any inter-State river (ISR). Accordingly, the Parliament enacted the Inter-State River Water Dispute Act, 1956, which provides for the reference of such a dispute to an inter-state tribunal. The said Act bars the Supreme Court or any other Court from exercising jurisdiction in respect of any water dispute, which may be referred to a Tribunal under it. The main reasons for keeping river disputes out of the purview of the courts' jurisdiction are:
(A) Ensuring the speedy disposal of ISR water disputes - Given that the jurisdiction of the SC is barred, the Act envisages the decision of tribunal as being final and binding. The idea was to avoid protracted court proceedings on account of the States litigating amongst themselves. 
(B) Since resolution of ISR disputes hinges upon heaps of technical and scientific data, the resolution of such disputes by specialized tribunals would allow for better appreciation such data.
(C) Unlike courts which are required to strictly adhere to procedure and legalese, the proceedings before a tribunal are relatively more informal, thus enabling deliberative and discretionary decision-making for ‘mutually negotiated settlements’.
In this light, it can be argued that the rationale behind excluding the jurisdiction of courts was fairly well intentioned.

The problem lies elsewhere and have been well documented by many commissions including the Sarkaria Commission. These include:
(A) Inordinate delay in settling such disputes;
(B) Inadequate provisions for the enforcement of the Tribunal's award;
(C) Non compliant States
(D) Politicization
The solution to these lies in amending the Inter-State River Water Disputes Act to strengthen provisions relating to timely settlement of disputes and enforcement of the award. In addition to this, the need of the hour is to develop a national outlook in relation to water resources and infuse a spirit of mutual accommodation in inter-state relationship in order to create a favorable atmosphere to settle ISR water disputes.
