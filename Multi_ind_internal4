REd corridor and NE violence
Simillarties
1)Both are violent in nature
2)Both are supported by foreign powers
3)Both have formed political factions like CPI(M) in Red Corridor and NSCN in North East
4)both tried by GOI to stop by force and development measures.
5)Members of both the region have established their bases in neighboring countries also
6)Both have common goal to undermine the sovereignty of democratic government.
Diff:
-AFSPA to control voilence in NE but not in Red corridor
-REd corridor want to capture power , NE it is about secession from indian union.
-More faction in NE than red corridor
-Red corridor faction CPI{M} able to find place in lok sabha , not NE
-Spread of red corridor (around 1/3 districts) more than NE.V
waterway benefit
1)Less cost 2_Env friendly 3)Less transit loss 4)Very less maintenance cost.
fuel efficient: for each hp of energy input max load can move on water.
convenient: mode of transport for bulky, hazardous or odd
sized cargo

Railway Bibek Debroy committee recommendation
-Commercial Accounting for better cost benefit analysis
- Changes in Human Resources -decentralization of power and lateral entry for specialization
-Gradual Liberalisation - Gradual entry of private operators in freight and passengers corridors but only after independent regulator is in place.
-Restructuring - separation of the core functions of railways from its additional responsibilities like running schools, hospitals etc
-Shifting of regulatory responsibility from the government to an independent regulator
-Leveraging the existing resources of the IR to raise funds
-Merging the Railway budget into the general budget after all such reforms are done in a time frame of 5 years

my adivse
-Split personality disorder should be done away coz to compensate loss from passenger fare freight fare is increased
-RAilway tarrif authority to depoliticise rail fare.


public investment than private for some sectors
(Shift in govt PPP with govt sharing major risk to boost private investment-irrelevant here)
-Reason for govt Shift from private to public
->Some sector like railway,aviation in very bad situation. no private player willing to invest
-agricultural sector need support bcoz of falling price,bank has long NPA so less fuding capacity
-Digital india/make in india private sector can't bear it alone.
->Alos private growth has sluggish in current time.
-Policy paralysis in past time demotivated them. So govt want to set the tempo right.
-Post govt investment once the sector revive it can be taken up fruther with private funds
Source of funds
-FDI + PSU disinvestment + Coal/specture auctions,More tax receipts, broader tax base coz of GST
-insurance reforms , infra bonds, kisan vikas patra,CAD in check so RBI has more room.
-Muncipal bonds
=The advantages of public sector driven growth and subsequentprivate sector investment 
-Will improve health of thesse critical sectors like railway
-will have spill over effect on other sectors
-Will boost private sentiments
-More jobs + more growth
->Disadvantages
-CAn effect CAD targets
-Other sectors like edu ,health can feel the hit.
-Social security schemes might be effected.
-increased public spending without reforming system can increase corruption and red tape.

Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers’ Rights (PPV&FR) Act of India 2001.
-seeks to establish a regime which benefits both plant breeders(will thrust agri growth by 
attracting investment in R&D of plant variety,enhance the availability of high quality seeds 
and planting materials) and farmers rights
-Help farmers to protect traditional varieties
-Plant Varieties Registry is established to enable registering of varieties.
- a farmer/breeder may seek registration of agricultural material including seeds/plant varieties
-Upon registration, the farmer is granted rights including the right to save, use, sow, re-sow, 
exchange, share or sell his farm produce including seed protected under this Act
-exception that he will not be entitled to sell branded seed of a protected variety
-Compensation to farmer if registered variety don't perform as promised under given condition.
-Act sets up a Protection of Plant Variety & Farmers Rights Authority to perform all functions.
-All this is simillar to practice of geo-tagging special breeds of
basmati from states such as MP.


-ve:
-Payment of annual fee to maintain legal protection.
-if not paid for 2 years the registration may be forfeited.
-provisions which allows for the recovery of the amount due by way of land revenue arrears. 
-Above goes against act objective.

New procurement law
-Ministry of Finance is seeking suggestions to refine the Public Procurement Bill of 2012, introduced by the previous government.
	procurement policy 2012
	features:
	The Salient features of the Public Procurement Policy are as under:
	-Every Central Ministry/Department/PSU shall set procurement goal of minimum 20 per cent of the total annual purchases of the products or services produced or rendered by MSEs.
	Out of 20% target of annual procurement from MSEs,  20% out of 20%) will be earmarked for procurement from MSEs owned by SC/ST entrepreneurs.
	The overall target of 20% is proposed to be made mandatory at the end of 3 years.
	For enhancing the participation of SCs/STs in the Government procurement, the Central Government Ministry/Department/PSUs will organise special Vendor Development Programmes, Buyer-Seller Meets etc.
	-MSME procurement goal and status so far to be part of agency annual report.
	The MSEs participating in a tender quoting price within the band of L1+15% may also be allowed to supply at L1 price where L1 price is from someone other than an MSE. Such MSEs may be allowed to supply up to 20% of the total tendered value. In case of more than one such MSEs, the supply will be shared equally.
	-continue to procure 358 items from MSEs, which have been reserved for exclusive purchase from them.
	-Defence equipments and imports out of this 20% quota.
	A Review Committee has been constituted under the chairmanship of Secretary (MSME) for monitoring and review of the Public Procurement Policy for MSEs. In addition, a ‘Grievance Cell’ would be set up in the Ministry of MSME for redressing the grievances of MSEs in Government procurement.
	cons
	*Bill’s objective is too complex, which dilutes accountability
	*Bill’s definition of the ‘procurement process’ implies that post-tendering steps such as contract management, payment, monitoring and so on, after the award of a contract, are excluded from the ‘procurement process’
	*given judicial delays and the lack of economic literacy often displayed by the judiciary, non-judicial procurement redress committees are preferable
	*Bill is not applicable to procurements for less than Rs. 5 million,below this procurement descrition not defined.
	*corruptions and poor quality of procured goods and services etc. 
-The jurisdiction of the Bill covers any Ministry or Department and any public sector undertaking of the Union government, or any company in which the government has a stake of more than 50 per cent. 
-state local procurement not covered
what should be in new policy
- procurement issue redress should be redefined to avoid any misuse by procurement agencies
 -international practice is to designate a nodal agency for procurement. Hence, we need to clarify whether the proposed Central Purchasing Organisation (CPO) will be such an agency
+ve of new/good procurement bill
-fiscal savings from annual procurement expenditure
-could also help in a shift towards rule-based institutional procurement.
-will assist in improving the accountability of procuring agencies, and facilitate the task of internal and external auditing agencies
challenges for new policy
- Enhancing data management capabilities and standardisation which will ensure transparency in public procurements.
-poor data about procurment figures so challanges in planing the things
-kill sets of the officials, who will be at the interface of public procurement
- 2012 Bill contains more than 20 references to ‘rules’ , general principle on which rules is to be based
require clarity
-Need to upgrade infrastructure (For e.g IT Infrastructure for e-procurement)
-Strengthening CCI to check cartelization while procurement
-Adoption of Global best practices like OECD Guidelines In Public Procurement
-intl pressue to include even foreign firm in procurement policy.

Prevention of money laundering act 2002
->Money laundering is refered to  transforming the proceeds of crime into ostensibly legitimate
 money or other assets
-usually done by method Placement (puting money in service company), Layering (layering that money
 with legitimate one),integration (money is integrated into mainstream ecomony)
- to prevent money-laundering and to provide for confiscation of property derived from money-laundering
 guilty of money-laundering shall be punishable with rigorous imprisonment from three years to seven years
 - liable to fine of up to INR500000 (US$7,900)
 -2012 amendment has done away with this upper limit
 -Appropriate authorities  can provisionally attach property believed to be "proceeds of crime" for 180days
 =creation of Adjudicating Authority to give decision about whatever any property seized is related 
 to money laundering or not.
 -Appellate Tribunal -to hear the appeal against adjudicating authority decision.
 -Accused  has to prove that alleged proceeds of crime are in fact lawful property
 
 PAtriot ACt
 -US law after the 9/11 terrorist attack
 -reduced restrictions in law enforcement agencies' gathering of intelligence within the United States
 -expanded the Secretary of the Treasury’s authority to regulate financial transactions exp wrt 
 foreigner or foreign entities
 -broadened the discretion of law enforcement and immigration authorities in detaining and deporting immigrants 
 suspected of terrorism-related acts
 -expanded the definition of terrorism to include domestic terrorism
 -enlarging the number of activities to which the USA PATRIOT Act’s expanded
 
 PPP model
-> PPP modle picked up actually during 2000 , pre that it was like
 -> govt used to pull in private players who don't have enough capital but expertise of 

execution
->Most of the risk was to be born by govt.
->assured return to private player irespective of project performance.
Problem with pre 2K model
-> since govt is major risk taker so private player don't bother about the quality of the 

delivery
-Project plan was not evaluated fully considering all the risks 
-High chance of political intervention as govt has powers
-Corruption and nepotism
-Project delivery plan not followed properly so unnecessarliy delays.
Budget[2015] provision to clearpending PPP projects
-To enable more finance fiscal deficit target date of 3 percent is postponed to 2017-18.
-High power independent negotiation committee to solve stalled ppp projects in railways
-Transferring risk in PPP implementation projects to govt rather than private player as it 
increase their cost over the time.Risk is there due to land acquistion , env clearances 

issues etc
-to reduce the stress of NPA's on banks and thus a possible legal hassle for players 

involved in long gestation infrastructure projects, government proposed to institute a 

National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) with an annual inflow of Rs 20,000 crore 

to finance infrastructure projects.
-NIIF will raise debt and invest it as equity in infrastructure finance companies such as 

the Indian Railway Finance Corporation and National Housing Bank, who, with a stronger 

equity base, in turn, will raise more debt to invest in infrastructure.
-A promise on new Bankruptcy law for early recognition of stress to refinance them and also 

enabling an early exit for private players in case on unviability 
-Decision to increase capital expenditure of PSU to develope infrastructure.

problem due to stalled PPP projects
-_ve effect on infra development
-big NPA assests for banks

PPP
PPP has had its share of success and failures. The huge infrastructure projects across the country are testament to their success whereas the large number of stalled projects are proof of their failure. To address the PPP model, the present economic scenario must be understood.
1) Corporate balance sheets are overburdened and debt ridden.
2) Banks have over capitalised. NPAs are huge.
3) International economic growth is slowly gaining traction.
4) China's advantage as a manufacturing hub is reducing due to increased labour wages.

In this context, the following measures shall be taken to revive PPP model :
1) PPP needs to be transformed into FPTP I.e first public than private. Public investment upfront during the high risk period and then private investment during the low risk period is the way forward.
2) Need to develop our corporate bond market for long term financing. 
3 Recapitalisation of PSBs with stringent measure to ensure the folly of NPAs doesn't return.
4) Indian economic diplomacy of attracting foreign investment presently is in the right direction and should be followed by ensuring "ease of doing business".
5) The public should be made aware and encouraged in invest in equity market and corporate bonds rather than gold.
6)Easy exit for investor if project becoming non sustainable for him with strict safeguard for public and state capital.
7)making projects plug and play type . i.e all clearances and land etc in place before project is granted.
8)Independent regulator 
9)Negotiation commission to bring the stalled projects back to life.

EPC mode (Engineering,procurement,construction)
-new system of private sector participation adopted by government of india to overcome the shortcomings of ppp model.
-in epc mode of business model the 90% land is to be acquired and fund is transferred to the player before the starting point
- it is to be completed in a predefined time frame, the risk of the project lies more on the contractors (turn key project) and unlike ppp the profit margin is fixed in this case
-In ppp mode of project operator was liable to build, operate and transfer the project to the government after completion while profit is to be acquired by either annuity paid or by levying toll
-
Advantage
-no prob of land qcquistion -> no probject dealy -> no cost boost
-cost is know at the starting of project
-fixed profit for private player so boost corporate sentimetns
-time bound complition of project

-India Thermal Power plan(TPP) issues
-generates 60% of India’s energy. 
-should be slowly converted into renewable energy to save climate issues.
Some major issues with TPP and actions needed to improve performance and efficiencies are:
(1.) based on old technologies of steam boilers and are lesser efficient. This leads to lesser
 energy for same amount of coal.
(2.) Indian TPP directly use coal mainly Lignite which emits lots of smoke and GHG, developed 
nation, they first convert coal into coke or some intermediate process makes coal more efficient in energy emitting.
(3.) India’s TPP doesn’t burn Coal completely, instead go for efficient use of furnace fire by 
rejecting last steps
for burning. In better performed TPP, they have processes to change burning coal also, to use 80% 
burnt coal in lighting up 
new coal and not generating heat for steam.
Indian TPP rejects this Coal at last stage and leads to heat pollution in water resources and Carbon
 Monoxide formation.
(4.) TPP produces vast amount of flyash because of low quality Indian coal,
mandated to make bricks only of Flyash and cement factory should use flyash but not implemented well.
(5.) Coal handling in Indian mines are mostly manually and in open trucks and train freight, which get exposed
 to moisture and reduces calorific values.


-nuclear power program
-4th largest electricity generator after thermal , hydroelectrical and renewable sources.
-Aim to make 25% nuclear power by 2050.
-21 reactors in 8 nuclear power plants [nanora,kakrapara (gujrat), tarapur , BARC , Rajasthan,kaiga in karnataka , kundamkulam(TN), chennai, jaitapur 9th proposed.]
- low availability of Uranium but large deposits of Thorium[Monazite powder, a rare earth and thorium phosphate mineral in south india]
-only around 1–2% of the global uranium reserves but 25% of thorium
- 500 GWe for at least four centuries using just the country’s economically extractable thorium reserves
-import thousands of tonnes of uranium from Russia, Kazakhstan, France, and Uzbekistan
recent deals with Canada and Australia
=Thorium
-Thorium itself is not a fissile material, and thus cannot undergo fission to produce energy
-must first be converted into the fissile isotope uranium-233 by transmutation in a reactor fueled by other fissile materials
- The first two stages, natural uranium-fueled heavy water reactors and plutonium-fueled fast breeder reactors, are intended to generate sufficient fissile material from India's limited uranium resources so that thorium reserve can be used in 3rd stage.

- led to conceiving of 3 stage nuclear power programme 
- based on a closed fuel cycle, where the spent fuel of one stage is reprocessed to recover fuel for the next stage
-1st stage PHWRs[pressurized heavy water reactor] to be used to process natural uranium.give depleted uranium (U) and PU as remanant. 
-Spent uranium fuel and PU and thorium will then be utilised in fast breeder reactors to produce U-233 which is fissile material

-Advanced Heavy Water Reactor
(AHWR) based on U- 233-thorium cycles uses light water as coolant and heavy water as moderator.

Power Grid Corporation Limited (PGCIL) 
-center owned
-has many functions in electricity sector including transmission, collection of surplus from state government and tariff rate collection
-A new company called Posoco was recently made the grid manager, separating it from PowerGrid
-Central transmission utility(CTU) conduct operation of transmitting power from producers to electricity boards and  involved in planning transmission systems and operations. Since 2011 procurement of transmission was made mandatory by bidding process[ except for projects of 'strategic importance/time bound delivery].There was a conflict of interest when PGCIL acted both as CTU and also as tariff rate collection agency. It has access to information that was not available to private companies.
-recently govt has separated CTU functions from power grid
-Even in terms of environmental clearances, there was a separate dispensation for private (companies). govt have also made it the same now 
effects
-By separating each function into an independent agency, management will become easier
-as an independent body CTU will have to compete private sectors independently this will give fair trial to each bidding agent.
-PGCIL will be able to manage its other functions better
- Private technology and private management will add to the strength of energy sector so may bring down cost by increasing efficency

SC order on Renewable purchase order (RPO)
-Judgement given in Hindustan Zinc Vs the Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission 2015,
-judgement concerned with the enforcement of renewable purchase obligation(RPO) rules.
-RPO imposed by Electricity Regulatory Commissions of various states, particularly those which have high renewable energy potential. 
-Used to add certain percentage of renewable engery to total enery basket of consumer and producers by making certain portion being mandatory from renewable sector.
1) The Renewable energy sector, hitherto sluggish, will get a big boost.
2) Renewable energy is environmentally beneficial. 
3) Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) lie unused at the exchange. Since, RPO obligations can be met by purchasing RECs, the REC market will get a boost and hence, an incentive to produce more and more renewable energy to get more RECs.
4)-will decrease dependency on coal based power -> less coal import

-cons
However, in the short run till the production costs of renewable energy reduces, it will harm the producers and distributors.
-problem of connective renewable power to grids is one issue
-can have -ve impact on power supply during peak season as renewable supply is limited

-Government is acting as a facilitator and subscriber is paying for it.No load on govt finances
Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana[Accidental insurance]
-is for accidental death/Full disability , which will give 2 lac insurance for Rs 12 with rs 1 per month

PM Jivan Jyoti Bima yojna [Life insurance]
-330 rupees for life
-any person with bank account b/w 18-50 yrs
Cons
-No medical test: Currently insurance companies are not doing any medical tests for subscribers but they are taking a self declaration from the applicant that he or she does not suffer from medical issues

-Attitude of insuance companies is such that they look for eveyr possible way to deny the claims 
-Jivan jyoti lapse when you cross 55

Atal Pension Yojna
-42-210 rs premium age b/w 18-40 .pension post 60 1000 to 5000
-to encourage working poor (all citizen in unorganised sector not member of any statutory social 
security scheme.) to join NPS.

- pension of upto Rs. 5000 to people working in unorganized sector after 60 years of age
-The government will also contribute a max of 50% or rs.1000 to the schemes of those who register before
31 December 2015 for period of 5 year. till 2019-20
-Existing subscriber of swavalamban will be auto migrated to APY unless they opt out.
-pension payment will vary according to age of joining and contribution made.
prob
- delay in deciding the nodal implementation agency
-pension amounts under the National Social Assistance programme, which are legal
obligations under the Unorganized workers social security act 2008 are not
sufficient for survival in today's inflation
-On non contribution for a period 6 months accounts will be frozen, for 12 months accounts will be deactivated and for 24 months accounts will be closed, while constantly attracting fines for the full period of non-payment.
-interest being paid seems low i.e around 7% when comparaed to other scheme like PPF and NPS

Mine Ban Treaty
-India yet to signed , signed by 80% of the government in world
-About anti personnel landmines generally used in border warfares.

Why india not signing
-To form line of defence against terrorist entering India
-used to check infiltration on PAk border
-Somtimes also used to check Naxals movements
-Ve
->During operation PRakaram many landmines planed in agriculture fields Many of them 
untraceable now and cause military civilian casuality .
-Spoil agri land for use.
-Can create life threating situation
Way Forward
-CAn be replaced by modern day methods
-Laser/Electrical fencing etc.
