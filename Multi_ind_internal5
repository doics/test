Naga peace process
=stake holders
1- The government of India and the state government of Nagaland +Manipur and assam
as these two states have naga population.
2- The Church and citizens groups vouching for peace in all factions.
3- Rebel groups Mainly the NSCN-K (national socialist council of Nagalim ,K for khaplang which operates out of
northwestern Myanmar want autonomy for nagaland and special control to naga people
->NSCN- IM(Isaac-Muviah) which operates from within Indian territory
(Naga hills)- want direct central govt administration on hilly area as they feel plain 
living majority govt has neglected them.
4- United Naga council from the Naga majority states in Manipur.
wants all naga majority areas to be accumulated into nagaland state.
The demands of the stake holders evolved from original Naga demands for sovereign statehood
to now, integration of all Naga- majority areas within India into Nagaland.
Solutions.
1- Enlarging the state by the unification of Naga districts of Manipur and other North-eastern
states into Nagaland. This will be met with stiff resistance from the non- Naga
Manipuri populace.
2- Another, more drastic solution would be to seek the cooperation of Myanmar’s government
and stop armed struggles from operating across the border between the countries.
The Naga issue has been festering for far too long and should be resolve coz naga important for NE
development, act east policy and security as it has porous border.

National Monsoon mission
-Under min of Earth and science. [MOES]
-still all the factors affecting Monsoon have not been discovered.
-moonson is unpredictale and effect agri , so import to have
precious predictions about the same.
-it is assimilation and forecasting system especially for the monsoon region on the national scale under the leadership of IITM.
The main objectives of the National Monsoon Mission are:
1) To build a working partnership between the academic and R&D organisations both national and international and the operational agencies to improve the operational monsoon forecast skill over the country.
2) To set up a state of the art dynamic modelling framework for improving the prediction skill of:
a. Seasonal and extended range prediction system (16 days to one season)
b. Short to medium range prediction system (up to 15 days).
-To set up the infrastructure and manpower required to improve the prediction skill at all the time scales.
Achievements:
1-> To implement a dynamic prediction system for the prediction of monsoon in all time scales(seasonal and intra seasonal scale)
2-> short range to seasonal time scale at appropriate spatial scales with improved prediction skill. 
3-> The forecasts based on this prediction system will cater to the needs of various sectors like agriculture,water resources management,power generation, disaster management, tourism and transport.
4-> Forecasting of extreme events, such as El Nino, flood and drought years.

The Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) will coordinate and lead the effort for improving the forecasts on seasonal and intra seasonal scale. National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) will lead and coordinate the efforts for improving the forecasts in the medium range scale up to week two forecasts. These will be made operational by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).

Micro finance institute Bandhan
--Within the microfinance community there is distinction between poor an ultra poor
->Model followed by them is BRAC's model [read note on BRAC below first]
-BANDHAN has implemented BRAC’s model of graduation, which causes significant impact on consumption level of the poor people
-Targeting the ultra-poor people , providing the food security through incentives,
-motivating them for saving to build assets, providing training and guidance to achieve better future and finally providing them the livestock’s and other incentives[making handicrafts,toys etc which are sold through stores similar to BARC retail store Aarong.] to start the economic activities
-The model implementing agencies are the provider of following services-
1. livelihood provider [first step to make poor food secure. As households have a more secure supply of food, the focus shifts to the asset transfer and livelihood trainings]
2. Financial service provider [to make them self sustainable.]
3. Healthcare and other service provider

-This empowered the poor people to live with dignity and enhance their earning through the economic activities.
Mechanism
-poor Household selection through participatory wealth ranking

-organized the isolated poor and learned to understand their needs by finding practical ways to increase their access to resources,
-support their entrepreneurship and empower them to become agents of change. Women and girls have been the focus of BRAC’s anti-poverty approach

On the face of it, India may appear to have made great strides in reducing the maternal mortality rate by 65 per cent, from 569 per one lakh live births in 1990 to 190 in 2013. But scratch the surface, and the real picture emerges. In 2013, India had 17 per cent (50,000) of the global maternal deaths. Together with Nigeria at 14 per cent (40,000), the two countries accounted for one-third of total global maternal deaths. The MMR of 190 last year is much higher than the government’s target of below 100 by 2012. Also, India is yet to achieve the expected average annual maternal mortality rate decline of 5.5 per cent or more during the period 1990-2013 to reach the Millennium Development Goal 5 target. With only a 4.5 per cent decline in MMR during the last 23 years, the country falls under the “making progress” category and would fail to meet the MMR target of 109 before 2015. The only silver lining is that India has been making steady progress in reducing the MMR since 1990. But for a country where an estimated 26 million deliveries take place annually, the absolute number of maternal deaths continues to be high.

Besides the medical reasons like severe bleeding and infections after childbirth and high blood pressure levels during pregnancy, one of the factors that is playing a big role in maternal mortality is the lack of skilled care “before, during and after childbirth.” Maternal mortality is counted when deaths occur during pregnancy or in the first 42 days after the birth of the child, caused either directly or indirectly by pregnancy. One way of tackling this is by having more institutional deliveries. India launched a programme in 2005 to facilitate such deliveries on a larger scale than was prevalent, but the results were not encouraging: there was no corresponding decline in the number of deaths. The reason for that is not difficult to find. In 2008, more than 50 per cent of women in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, and 41 per cent in Rajasthan, continued to deliver at home, according to a United Nations Population Fund-India report. Therefore, a greater focus on increasing the number of well-trained birth attendants should go hand in hand with promoting institutional deliveries. According to a 2008 UNICEF report, the quality of training of such attendants has been found to be “poor” in these three States that fare badly. The 2013 UNICEF report also found many other inadequacies contributing to poor outcomes when deliveries took place in health centres. Insufficient availability of health workers at primary care levels and “gaps” in the availability of equipment and supplies are some of them. The need for India to take up a more serious and multi-pronged approach to bring down the MMR cannot be overemphasised.
