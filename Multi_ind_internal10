Air Defence
Tejas/RAfel miscelleneous
- India is French Dassault Aviation's first export client
-India tried its indigenous jet engine KAveri for tejas but it failed so end up imported engine
-TEjas can replace mig 21 which is also low end fighter aircraft
-Can;t replace MMRCA like RAfel or Sukhoi-30MKI 
-RAfel has 3 times range and weapon load carring capacity than Tejas
-each tejas to cost 220-250 cr .planned 120 for IAF and 50 for Navy
-dec 2015 - final operation clearance for tejas slated
-17-18 ->first squadron of 20 tejas to be delievered
-18-19 - 2nd squadron
-21-22 -> likely to begin getting 80 Tejas mark 2

Mirage upgrade
-Signing of the contract for upgrade of the IAF's Mirage 2000 fleet took place in July, 2011
-April 15 Dassault aviation handed over 2 upgraded mirage to IAF.
-rest of IAF's Mirage 2000 aircraft will be upgraded in Bengaluru 
under the supervision of HAL with support from Dassault and Thales
-The equipment kit for the upgrade was provided by Thales and comprised radar, 
electronic warfare suite and mission computer.

Navy
aircraft carriers, the ageing 56-year-old INS Viraat, retire by early-next year
-will leave the force with just the 44,400-tonne INS Vikramaditya, the refurbished Admiral Gorshkov inducted from Russia in  November 2013
-The 40,000-tonne indigenous aircraft carrier or INS Vikrant being built at Cochin Shipyard, in turn, will be ready for induction only by 2018-2019 
- fast-track finalization of the long-pending ambitious plan to indigenously construct the country's largest-ever aircraft carrier, the 65,000-tonne INS Vishal.for this details yet to be finalized.

-Chief of Defence Staff
-Demand for creation of this post for better integration and coordination of our security forces
-currently All 3 service staff individualy report to defence ministy without any coordination among them
Why CDS required
-Better cordination and better intelligence sharing (Kargil failure)
-can give more holistic view to Def min about forces requirement and bottleneck
-Modern warfare require deep cordination in various arms of forces
-Will help to leverage the existing security infrastructure and weapons more judicialy

Problem
-Find suitable candidate for CDS as he might have experiece working with only one force
-might increase friction with other two forces.


->Withdrawal of exemption of Excise & custom duty to Ordinance Factory Board & Defence PSU
-step in the direction of market reform aiming towards fostering competiton & innovation in manufacturing sector necessary for growth
Why done
-Due to associated benefits, the Public sector has become lethargic and sub -standard
-DPSus & Ofb had unfair competitiive advantage in the form of excise & custom duty exemptions despite being inefficient & ineffective
-thwarted private investment in defence sector as they did not have level playing field
-Bases of FDI was focused on cost advantage not quality and efficiency

Effects
-This will give a boost to manufacturing in line with "Make in India program
-collaboration will be on the basis of efficiency not for exempting taxes
-force Public sector to become more competitive.
-May increase FDI investment at a faster rate.
-Reduction in import of defense equipment 
-Increased chances of getting up-to-date technologies in defense equipments 


Delhi state status and crisis
-After the capital was shifted from Calcutta, Delhi was initially a Chief Commissioner’s province. Post-independence, it was a Part C state, with a CM between 1952 to 56. As per the recommendations of the 1955 States Reorganization Commission , Delhi became a Union Territory under the direct administration of the President.
-After much deliberation, Delhi’s status was upgraded from being a Union Territory by devolving many power through 69th constitutional amendment but making it short of a full state. Subsequently land, police and pubic order were kept out of its jurisdiction by enacting the Constitutional provision (art 239AA) (69th amendment)through National Capital Territory of Delhi act (1991).
-Example of how other state administrate their national capital
London- Accomodating more than 15% of England’s population, London enjoys near total autonomy including police. But Greater London police does not have authority over area with seat of central power. Even Greater London sends 70 MPs to House of Commons! In all matters, the assembly has full power with executive power with an elected Mayor.
Paris- It is quite opposite to London. Depite having considerable say on local issues, special power of French republic curtails its power in policy formation and implementation.
Canberra and Washington DC- Despite in federal nations, they don’t enjoy autonomy on par with other states. Central government has larger role in city administration.
China-Being an one party, unitary state very few power has been devolved to city administration. Most decisions are taken by central government

'doctrine of hot pursuit' w.r.t India Mynmar strike

-evolved from the sea as an exception to the fundamental principle of freedom of the high seas.
-empowered a coastal state to pursue a vessel that had committed a crime within its territorial waters outside them. 
- such pursuit could not be extended to the territorial waters of any other state.
-application of the 'doctrine of hot pursuit' on land has been rejected as such it is against the sovereignty of a nation. 
-if strictly viewed from the prism of international law, the application of the doctrine for surgical strikes is not legally tenable.
-But 2010 Security agreement was signed between India and Myanmar say that each country could cross the border if required and if they had information about terrorists using the territory of the other.
-However, the position on this is muddled. And in future, it would be more appropriate to use the 'Doctrine of Self Defense',(which used by US after9/11 attach) to justify such operations. Also, such covert operations need not be publicised to ensure that friendly governments are not embarrassed and the covert capabilities of the country are kept a secret
