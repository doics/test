Deep sea fishing policy. Meenakumari committee
->What is Deep sea
-2 factor horizontal and vertical. Deep sea is with avr depth of 200 meter and horizontally where continental shelf ends 12 nm (limit of territorial water)
-In inda up to teritorial water(12nm from baseline) state govt has control and from 12nm to 200 nm (EEZ) falls under centre.

- Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying & Fisheries, Ministry of Agriculture in August 2014. 
-Fishing being followed by many as source of livelihood
- The 12th FYP also suggested a renewed focus on this sector by modernization of fishing trawlers,introduction of mother vessels and ugrading cold storage facilities
-committee formed to take forward blue revolution agenda of govt
-recommendations
-most potential resources are limited to 22-370 km of Exclusive Economic Zone. So; effort should be made to make maximum utilisation of within this limitation.
-The committee suggest that resources beyond 200 metre depth of sea are overexploited and some species will be on the verge of extinction in this way
-india lacks expertise to exploit resources beyond 500 metre. The committee recommends involvement of joint venture with foreign companies and transfer of technology for this purpose.
Pro of new deep sea fishing policy
-Promotes the import of foreign technologies
Ø increases foreign investments
Ø will increase the revenue and the production of fisheries in india which is below optimal level at presen
ø will lead to development of backward and forward linkages,cold storages and supply chain
-issues :
1.	EEZ : guidelines permit deep sea fishing with LoP(letter of permission) from the centre.
Problem:10 coastal states had opposed this. 
2.	Joint ventures : big vessels with a length 15 metre or more that can be owned or acquired by Indian entrepreneurs of the country. Joint ventures with up to 49 per cent foreign investments are allowed to apply for permission.
Problem : will affect livelihood of fishermen as they use motorised or mechanized boats and are below 15mts
3.	Environmental hazard : foreign and commercial interests in deep seas will lead to indiscriminate fishing and hazard to marine resources
4.	contradicts report of Murari committee : which had opposed issuance of further licences to foreign fishing vessels
5.	Further, these big vessels are permitted to export their catch from the sea itself without making a landing on the shore.
6.	Fisher communities not consulted
