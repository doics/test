Govt 20 point programme
-launched by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1975
Twenty point programme was last restructured in 2006, 
-Programmes and Schemes under TPP-2006 are in harmony with the priorities contained in the National
Common Minimum Programme, the Millennium Development Goals of the United Nations and SAARC Social Charter.
it is an amalgamation of such schemes 
which addresses eradication of poverty and improvement in the quality of life.
=Design
The basic objective of the 20-Point Programme is to eradicate poverty and to improve the quality
 of life of the poor and the under privileged population of the country.
-Pre set physical targt for 20 crucial points 
For its performance government has established, “The management information system" relating to Twenty 
Point developed by the Ministry consists of a monthly Progress Report (MPR) and yearly Review of the Programme 
point wise , item wise and state wise.
Under this programme several acts has been passed by government like MNREGA, NFSA, RTE, etc. Many policies 
and schemes like Mid-Day Meal, ICDS, Sarvshikha Abhiyan, PM's 14 fourteen programme for minorities are being 
framed and implemented by government with help of states.
There has been certain change after implementation of these programmes, like decrease in BPL families, 
increase wages in rural areas, rise of literacy levels, rise in HDI performance of country, etc.
But, implementation and distribution of schemes and funds respectively are as usual with many discrepancies.
Many loopholes in PDS system, TPDS has fake beneficiaries, RTE needs schools and quality teachers. NFSA is 
lacking in nutrient value. Low Child sex-ratio even after many efforts to promote female child are seen in India.

Aadhar
Why privacy important
-Consitution gives citizen right of privacy and sharing aadhar info with 
investigating agency can violate it coz data collected for civil purpose.
-Can be misused for political purposes
-data Can be used by commercial players to effect the users buying habit.
->What should be done for privacy
-Steps to secure data
-Making it Hacking proof. Chines hacker angle
-Keeping in secure hands
-Exposing the minimum data to various agencies.
-Robust and unbreakable backup plan
-Good Privacy law to deter and punish the offenders along with etab of privacy
 commission at centre/state level.
-Still working on executable order need to give a legislative power.
-Should have clear guidelines about where can be used and where can't

-Agriculture employs 2/3rd of population and contributes 16% to The GDP
Agri institutonal subsidy
-Means subsidy given to farmers thorugh bank loans , kisan vikas patra
and agri bond
-given on low interest rate like 4.5%
-But 70% given inurban and only 30% in rural
-banks generally give to big farmers
-leveraging the loop hole in defination commercial bank also divert
the same to some agri related industry or effluent individuals.
-farmer endup with moneylenderers @ high interest rates
-problem in obtaining lonas as banks as collateral guarantee.
-lack of money so denpen on traditional methods -low output

-Terms of Trade
- relative price of exports in terms of imports and is defined as the ratio of export prices to import price
-amount of imports an economy can buy for per unit of export.
-For instance a economy exporting only bananas and buying only apples, 
it can be amount of apples it is able to buy for per banana. Since a basket 
of items are in imports as well as in exports therefore it is ratio of indices of prices recieved over prices paid
-in terms of agri industry it is ration of agree price to industry price
-better tot here means good agriculture price ->more farmer income
-it can well be applied to farmer , on money he spent and money he received through MSP etc.
-help him to decide profitable crop.
-ToT till 2010 increased due to Greater MSP ,growing DGP , less loan interest and contained inflation
-but psot 2010 global decrease in demand led to decrease in TOT
-growth in wages/diesel price incrase also increase prodution cost hence low TOT

-NSSO finding on loan on agri house hold (AHH)
-points to the increase in percentage of indebted AHHs
-rather than seeing the growing debt on cultivator can also be seen increased availability of institutional credit
-declining share of outsanding loans of AHH in prosperous states like Punjab, Haryana etc. point to the ability of farmers to repay the debt
-outstanding loans should be treated as credit increase rather than indebtedness coz there is higher credit deposit ration in Southern states
-Government intervention on financial inclusion which includes KCC, Priority sector lending, opening of new accounts and PMJDY in combination with development schemes also reflect on to the increased availability of institutional credit and enhanced credit worthiness respectively.
-Above reflect some optimism but actual conditions on the ground remains a serious cause for concern: due to problem mentioned above.


1991 LPG effect on agri [also check china/PAk eco corridor - $46B]
+ve -> more technology transfer into agri,more private investment,govt got more resources so more MSP , increased food processing sector, availability of modern agri equipments,open of export mainly rice lead to more income.

-ve: financial check by govt so less agri subsidy, ,migration of labour to non agri,less agri land due to acquistion for industry setup , increase used of ferti , pesti means pollution, monoculture coz MSP only for certain crops like wheat ,rice,unemployment in agri due to modern tools - disguised employment ,import of agri products hit certain farmers, loss of traditional growing crop.
-recent time policy adversaly effecting
-land acquistion includeing SEZ act.
-regulation of diesel more input cost 
-to curtail CAD less govt spendign on agri.
-sign of FTA lead to import based agri products
-Vacant un-utilised land


Reason for farm distress
-APMC act
-Monsoon driven agriculture
-lack of formal credit
-weak supply chain
-Food processing industry not fully developed
-unhealthy farm practices
-lack of scientific agriculte knowledge.
-labour intensive method.
-small land holding , shoody implementation of land reforms
-

national water policy 2012?

-Govt stesp to boost agri marketing
# Union will soon amend the APMC act to allow direct selling of farm produce such as fruits and vegetables to consumers.Have asked state to take fruit vegetables out of APMC. many states responded positively.
# It will cause more income to farmers as well as curb hoarding thus cheaper for consumers. It will remove the meditator.
# Development of a common national market through e-platforms, through Agri-Tech Infrastructure Fund (ATIF) of 200 crore to be implemented during 2014-15 to 2016-17.
# Removing restriction on movement of agriculture produce within the state which gradually will be extended through the country.
# Reducing the multiple licence cost will reduce the cost of transportation for exporting vegetable and fruits to international market.
# It will diversify the market for farmers as well as source for consumers.
# It will curb food inflation thus increasing the saving rate of the poor and middle class thus helping India's average saving rate of 30% to improve.
# Amendment Consumer Protection Act,1986 to make hoarding a non-bailable offence and improve 3-tier grievance redressal system.
# Union has sanctioned 42 Mega Food Parks across the country which will standardised the agriculture market tin on International lines.
#GST will lower taxes ,reduce price and increase food processing business
#Govt proposal for FDI in supply chain. (?)

->MSP
Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSPs at national level for twenty three crops
-currently it exist only for wheat/rice that too in selected state.
-Even in these states the major beneficiaries are big-farmers as 
they have resources for huge surplus production
-> high level committee has made the following reccomendations
- Outsourcing of stocks is to be done and no stock is to remain under storage for greater than 3 months
- Use of Silo bag technology is to be promoted 
- Direct farmer subsidey isntead of procurement to be suppored
- End to end computerisation from procurement to TPDS to be done
->Govt steps
-Central government has taken steps to limit procurement from states that provide bonus over MSP.
-Online procurement monitoring system is being developed to provide daily information of procurement countrywide.
-Decentralized procurement scheme is being implemented in certain states.limiting state's share to the requirement of their own state's PDS.This will break state monopoly and every state will have their own share of  procurement.
- This has dual benefit of reducing transportation cost and providing income security to poor region’s farmers.
-trying to rationalise the price support offered to different crops.state should also limit support above MSP
-open market sale by FCI would be done on behaf of government
-Many schemes for increasing the production of other crops like oil-seeds and 
pulses are been initiated
-cope of green revolution is expanded to include hitherto untouched area.i.e 2nd green revolution in N.E.
-Computerisation of procurement so as to plug leakages
->Consequences
-wastage of grain in FCI storage will come down.
-Rotting of stock will not happen as FCI can sell the surplus.
-decentralized storage will reduce transportation cost
-farmer will grow more crops to inflation down.like if pulses grown than pulses price come down.
- funds wasted on procurement, storage and transport might be used productively
-will tackle corruption and greater food will reach masses.
-Productivity would also increase due to multicropping


Agri New urea policy
-A highly regulated & controlled regime over a long period for urea discourages efficiency and new investment; as a result today domestic urea production is unable to meet domestic urea demand; forcing GoI to import urea.So new Urea policy 
affect on producers:

a) incentivize domestic urea manufacturing:
1. GoI to reimburse fixed cost incurred by domestic units that produce 100% more than their reassessed capacity along with a part of variable cost.
b) promote energy efficiency:
1. incentive given to domestic manufacturers will be linked to annual energy consumption.
c) freed transportation of P & K based fertilizers:
1. reduce monopoly of few companies in a particular area; permitting
any company can sell P and K in any part of country; thereby boosting
competition.
affect on consumers:
1. MRP for urea has been left untouched excluding local taxes; no additional burden on consumers.No increase in price for 4 years.
2. with boost in competition prices of P & K will come down.
3. promoting energy efficiency in urea production; cost reduction will reduce price.



->Pulse pattern
-Grown both in kharif and rabi crop
-mostly grown in central and decan india as climate suppor it there
-
Reason for price rise
-Low productivity of pulses which creates less incentives for farmers
-being replaced with rice/wheat as these have better MSP
-Lack of irrigation facilities 
-growing demand 

->National common agriculture market [agri is state subject so non uniformity]
-central government proposes to identify 50 regulated wholesale markets (mandis) across 10 states. Their functioning is to be reformed with the involvement of state governments.Later all mandis(585) to be covered
Why required
-Recent central govt provision to create a common national agri market.so that price disparity and disparity in tax levid @ mandi can be made uniform across nation
-Punjab leve around 14% mandi tax and MP around less than 5. so price difference
-Multiple tax are levied by different point
-trades create oligopoly in Mandi -> farmer exploitation
-trades pay huge licence fee -> corruption
-auction is not tranparent and leads to less crop price benefit to farmer
Provision
-Will create an online agriculture market
-also focus on creating go-downs and facilitating transportation of the farm produce after the online trade
-Will create a 
-single trading licence for the entire region.This will be valid for all farm markets across each State
-single-point levy of market fee (mandi tax).even if sold online the transactions will, however, be recorded as having been conducted through the mandi so APMC will continue earning Mandi fee.
-electronics auctions to make price uniform
- Then, the market in question would become eligible for funding under the initiative. 
- The Small Farmers Agri-Business Constortium will be the nodal agency to implement NAM e-platform .
-Also said that all states should drop fruit and vegetables from the APMC schedule of regulated commodities.
=Benefits Farmer 
-would enable farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country on a single license.not necessarily at APMCs.
-Taking fruit vegetables out of APMC will enable their sell at local mandis,which will give comptitition to APMC market and make them more efficent.
-transparent process of price discovery - no price manipulation
-The APMCs charge multiple fees, of substantial magnitude and often non-transparent - market fee on buyers, licensing fee from commission agents and fees from a whole range of functionaries. Commission agents also charge a fee on transactions between buyers and farmers.
-If price mechanism get stable it can also give relief to govt in terms of MSP subsidies.

->Agri- power tiller over tracor
->Advantages
-Low input cost
-low operational cost
-well suitable for fragmented land (like in India)
-Less weight than tracktor so don't damange soil much due to weight
-only alternate to manual labour in hilly area

-issues
-Safety is issue as it can cause physical damage to operator
-mindset of farmers
-Not as Mechanically operated as tractors (?)


->Cash crop of various climates
-Arctic
not conducive for the cultivation of cash crops. However, one potential cash crop for the Arctic is Rhodiola rosea, a hardy plant used as a medicinal herb 
-Temperate
many cereals (wheat, rye, corn, barley, oats), oil-yielding crops (e.g. rapeseed, mustard seeds), vegetables (e.g. potatoes), tree fruit or top fruit (e.g. apples, cherries) and soft fruit (e.g. strawberries, raspberries).
A tea plantation in the Cameron Highlands in Malaysia
-Subtropical
 grain crops (e.g. rice, millet), oil-yielding crops (e.g. soybeans) and some vegetables and herbs are the predominant cash crops.
-Tropical
- coffee,[3] cocoa, sugar cane, bananas, oranges, cotton and jute. The oil palm is a tropical palm tree, and the fruit from it is used to make palm oil.[7]

->Farmers switching to non cash crop oilseed or soyabean etc- reasons
-govt initiative like soil health card,krishi vigyan kendras, dd kisan for farmer awareness.
-irregularity in monsoon
-increasing demand
-increase in MSP . recent 7% increase in pulses is step toward crop neutral msp regime
-	change in agri pattern.
These changing pattern are not national rather regional in character. Some of trends are 
- The Maize production has increased in regions like Bihar (increased connectivity, strategic location for export to SE Asia, higher prices) 
- move towards Vegetables & floriculture in vicinity of urban areas 
- increased Soya Production in Madhya Pradesh (better linkage to market , availability of good quality inputs and suitable climate) 
- increased acreage under crops other than sugarcane in Maharashtra due to government efforts of ‘Beyond Sugarcane’ & ‘Jalyukta Shivar Abhiyan’ (aimed at creating decentralised water sources).


->distortion of the credit culture in agriculture RBI say give DBT to farmer 
-govt generally give subsidy to bank which give loan to farmer
-government provides three per cent interest subvention for short-term crop loans
-rising bad loans in the interest rate subvention scheme in agri sector was a concern was highlighted in RBI's recently-released annual report.
-it has raised bank NPA to higher level.
-Leakages and diversion of subsidies also there as identify worthy farmer big task for banks.
challenges
-identifying the beneficiary and managing the nework 
-


Armed forces
-include Army,navy and airforce, Coast guard also comes under arms forces
-comes under ministry of defence,Paramilitary forces comes under MO home affairs
-As per International Mandate Indian Armed forces being the federal cannot be deputed on the recognized international borders so other forces such as BSF ITBP etc protects the international borders(IBs)
-Indian Army can be deputed on disputed borders (as these are not recognized IBs) such as LOC and LAC.
-military forces play active lead roles while country fights external wars.

foreign security or any immovable property situated outside India is held in contravention of the provisions of 
this Act, then action may be taken for seizure and eventual confiscation of assets of equivalent value situated in India

loopholes in black money bill
But there are significant problems with the mechanism that is now being proposed.
-NRI not covered under this act so people might use them as shield to part their black money
-The bill states that it will be applicable only if government is able to detect incomes and wealth abroad but it does not lend any mechanism of how to do so.
-The Bill contains no mechanism to identify funds going out or being held abroad
-People generally park money through shell companes.. bill may fall weak on that.
1. Short compliance window : likely to have a negative effect on the incentives of tax evaders.
2. the punishments are very strong provisions indeed, and it is far from
certain that they have been properly thought through.
3. Does not deal with the problem of its generation; 
4. doesnot contain strategies to check black money's movement across borders
5.tax is proposed to be recovered on the “fair market value” of the asset and not the acquired value if over year asset market value increase substantialy owner may end up paying much more tax
6.can draw under his signature a statement of tax arrears of an assessee and it shall not be open to the assessee to dispute the correctness of any certificate drawn up by the officer on any ground whatsoever.so if assesse skip any information earlier they could correct during assessment but now 7 year imprisonment.


SIT recommendations blck money
-India's double taxation treaties and mutual assistance treaties of income-tax with other countries be redrafted as they are one-sided. DTAT with mauritious by many money trails in cold and no lack of coperation form their authority.
-to amend the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to introduce a provision under which the Enforcement Directorate (ED) would be able to attach the properties of those who do not bring back black money within the stipulated time frame.Currently only crime affilated property can be attached.
-possession and transportation of cash be regulated. This would entail placing limits on cash transactions and cash held for private use and confiscate extra if catched.
-Special courts to hear income tax prosecution cases must be set up
-central KYC Registry should be established with all law enforcement agencies, Registrar of Companies and financial institutions having access to its database.to catch multiple transactions by one person
-The Financial Intelligence Unit, which is the national center for receiving, analyzing and disseminating information related to suspected cases of money laundering, must be harnessed to exchange actionable intelligence on proceeds of crime in other jurisdictions.



The failure of centrally sponsored schemes in meeting their objectives can be attributed to following main reasons:-
1. little or insufficient co-ordinations and consultation by the central government with the states regarding framing of policies,allocation of funds , regional specific needs and their implementations.The erstwhile planning commission was the sole powerful body involved in planning CSSs .
2.'One size fits all' policy has been adopted in the implementation of CSSs so far and regional specific needs or state wise local needs has been overlooked.
3. Excessive involvement of the center in providing and allocating to the sectors such as education, agriculture and Health made these schemes inefficient and unworkable because they require local knowledge and hence they can be best provided by the states only .
4.too many number of schemes led to overlapping and interfering goals and implementation which took resources away from the core schemes.

Measures to bringing efficient and results oriented implementation of CSSs.
1. As suggested by the sub groups of CMs, the number of CSSs should be reduced to 25-30 from 66 currently because most of them have overlapping objectives and goals and combining them would mean more funds available to core schemes for each sector covered.
2.distinction of CSSs between core and optional schemes and funds allocation should be in the ratio of 60-40%.
3.flexibility and more discretionary powers to states in planning and implementation such schemes as per their individual needs.
4. active and greater role to CMs in NITI Ayog in planning and framing policies related the CSSs.
5. Regular preparation of progress reports and monitorization of schemes including tracking of funds utilization with strict punishment for any irregularity by officers involved.
