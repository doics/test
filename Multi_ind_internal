smart cities critical evaluation w.r.t existing schemes
1. JNNURM: Launched in 2005 till 2014, it focusses on providing technical assistance to cities in areas lkke transport(metro,RBTS), solid waste management and accomodation. overall impcat not much visible.
2. Indira Awaas yojana: Running since 1985, cash assistance to rural poor for affordable housing. prohibit use of contractors.
3. Rajiv Awaas Yojana: It focusses on urban poor and aims to make India slum free by 2022. It provides for affrodabke houses free of cost.
Most of the projects, including the recently rechristened AMRUT, face certaim challenges:
1.None focussed on city administration. All had to face the problems of division of powers between multiple bodies like transport authority municipalities, etc. This creates confusion and increases time taken for project completion.
2. Sporadic gains were made over distant places. Like JNNURM helped in transport in some cities whike in housing in some others. So a holistic development was not seen and consequently results were not effective as well.
The AMRUT project seeks 100 smart cities. If all new ones are to be created, it has challenges like land acquisition. If old ones are to be rejuvenated, it has challenges like administration complexity, resettlements, etc. But overall AMRUT must also focus on reforms in city administration, involve private sector and civil society, leverage new technologies in basic amenities like waste management and street lighting, better emergency services and space for migrants etc. so as to make our cities mire liveable.

Trbiunal
-Created under parliament act.
-Realted to a specific are like National TAx Tribunal
-Created as judiciary is overburdened with arrears
-These provide quick and informal justice mechanism
-Doing away with technical proceedings of courts which are generally costly.
-People friendly,Neutral and effective.
-
SC View
-These are enchroachment by executive on judiciary power and they don't follow principal laid down by it.
-Harm separation of power principal as sometimes even executive are appointed as members
-Its member should have same rank , qualification and experience as of a judge.
-Struck down the National TAx Tribunal based on this.
-SC want these under A 243 as it will bring them under HC control as normal courts(transfer,financial,
 admin,appointments)
-But these are created under A323A and 323B ->under govt control for above so not accountable to 
judiciary/independent

-Issue of Media ownership TRAI recommendation

->why regulation is required
-Media has big influence on junta's mind
-major TV networks in South and owned by politicians/parties
-There is also a menace of paid and sponsored news and with paid news declared as an electoral offence,At the international level, respected newspaper, Guardian has established a independent trust, insulating itself from the influence of businesses and politicians
-Maintaining plurality in media ownership is vital for functioning of democracy. 

TRAI's recommendation
1-TRAI had recommended max advertisement of 12 and 20 minutes for news and entertainment channels respectively. 
issue ->Revenue for chanells could be a problem as it is mostly driven from advertisement.But if digitalization is completed then viewer base will go up and hence we can cope with this.
2-TRAI has recommended that a business can participate in 2 of three major news stream, i.e TV, Print media and Radio
issue -> internet is left out which will have major influnce in future.
TRAI recommendation silent on paid news 



-US state sponsoring terror list
-The US maintains a list of state sponsors of terrorism and terms them as 'Rogue' states.
Common features :
1) Different political ideology from the US. Eg: Cuba and North Korea have communist regimes.
2) Openly confronts the USA when differences pop up. Eg Iran nationalized BP in 1970s
3) Aligning with enemies of the US. Eg: Cuba's alignment to the Soviet Union during cold war.
4) Alleged threat to American security.

This US policy certainly has an impact on India 
Pros:
1) Being an economic power, Americas intervention can release the burden from Indians shoulder. Eg: Significant American presence in Afghanistan and dealing with ISIS in Iraq and Syria
2) Many terrorists groups which target India also operate from some of these 'rogue' states.
Cons:
1) Many 'rogue' states in the US list are not 'rogue' to India. Eg: Cuba, Iran and Afghanistan
2) India maintains an independent foreign policy with her national interest as the top priority. So the American approach to Iran has negatively impacted India as it imports large amount of oil from Iran.
3)Effect of this Us discrimination on indian dispora settled in Middle east of these states
4)Pak which spoonser terror in india not present in this list.
5)Aligning with US on this might be misued by our enemny to radicaliz our youths.

Thus, it is clear that India doesn't differentiate countries as 'rogue' or 'not-rogue'. Rather,it deals with countries on an individual basis with national interest as its priority. So the US policy has limited India's engagement with other countries such as Iran and Cuba.
