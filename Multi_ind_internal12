Indardhanush

In the past few years Public Sector Banks (PSBs) have been struggling to deal with - (A) low profitability and (B) high non-performing assets (NPAs). It is against this background that the government seeks to revive PSBs and their performance with Indradhanush. The following are the seven main concerns that Indradhanush seeks to address

(A) Recapitalisation - Infusion of Rs 25,000 crore of capital in debt-laden banks.
(B) Appointments - Keeping in mind global best practices, the post of Chairman and Managing Director are to be seperated and there would be another person who would be appointed as non Executive Chairman of PSBs.
(C) Banks Board Bureau (BBB) - Bank governance the exiting Appointments Board is sought to be replaced by a BBB, which will be tasked with appointment of chairpersons and directors, besides guiding PSBs on matters of strategy.
(D) Governance - Regular Gyan Sangams, i.e., conclave of PSBs and financial institutions has been proposed to discuss the process of governance reforms
(E) Bad loans - NPAs burden of PSBs is sought to be addressed by way of developing vibrant debt markets for PSBs besides strengthening of asset restructuring companies and addressing the issues of stalled projects. 
(F) Empowerment - In this regard, banks have been assured that government will not interfere with their functioning besides allowing them flexibility in hiring manpower. 
(G) Accountability - A new framework - Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) has been proposed to measure the performance of PSBs.

While, the objectives of the Indradhanush initiative appear promising and its proposals welcome, some concerns remain:
(A) Critics argue that periodic bailout are akin to flushing money down the drain. Instead, they propose that recapitalisation must be strictly performance based.
(B) Given that the BBB will continue to have government nominees on board, it is nothing but a rechristened form of the exiting "Appointment Board". BBB could continue to face government interference in matters of appointments resulting in the casualty of merit.
(C) P J Nayak committee's recommendation regarding the setting up of a Bank Investment Company run entirely by professions, to which the government’s equity stakes in PSBs would be transferred, has largely been ignored.
(D) The Nayak Committee proposal on parity of practices between private and public banks has also been ignored.
(E) The measures in relation to NPAs are nothing but a reiteration of the existing measures being taken by the RBI and government in this regard.

Therefore, it appears there is little novelty in the Indradhanush initiative because its proposals are not new and have been "works in progress" for the last few years. However, it is hoped that this initiative works better in comparison to the earlier ones on account of the concerted efforts of all the parties involved.

Ocean Mixing and Monsoons and Air Sea Interactions in the Northern Indian Ocean-Regional Initiative (OMM-ASIRI) project

OMM ASIRI project is a joint collaboration between India and US to study one of the most complex feature of Indian Ocean: Monsoon.

Goal of OMM-ASIRI project:
-> To study and understand formation of cloud over Bay of Bengal
-> To prepare monsoon modelling
-> To access atmosphere of Indian ocean and find its role in weather phenomenon
-> Based on all studies, it wants to develop Monsoon forecasting system

Significance for India:

-> Indian monsoon is lifeline of rural India and thus its assessment will help them
-> Help India to sustain and adapt to climate changes
-> Will lead to new crop system in tandem with monsoon forecast
-> Help Indian Metrological Department to forecast flood, cyclones and related disasters
-> Help Government of India to plan food security and subsidies
-> Enhance mutual learning and technology exchange between India US
->Will lead to boost in R&D development in this field which may help to understand other phenomeanoun

It should be understood that India monsoon and tropical cyclone system are very complex to understand and predict with the existing technologies. Thus it would be for betterment of the mankind in Indian Ocean Region including India, Myanmar, Bangladesh if it can develop better system

Parliament accountability of autonomous institutes.

-Example of controversy b/w RBI and finance ministry good case to understand this.
-to boost eco FM want RBI to cut rates
-But RBI is going slow by keeping a good watch on inflation figure
-to take care of all econim sector imp for these two insti to work in coherent manner.
-Inflation targeting for RBI was a positive step in right direction.
-But more accountablity  should be through parliament than executive to avoid conflict of interest.


there is  lack of coherence between Finance ministry and RBI with both running in opposite direction and thus affecting the national prosperity.
To handle this situation the onus lies on parliament to establish fine balance between accountability and autonomy. It can do so by:
(a) Instituting a separate committee tasked with scrutinising the job of RBI and other regulators and presenting periodic reports to ensure accountability.
(b) Defining clearly the role and responsibilities of various regulator to prevent confusion and intrusion in each other’s domain.
(c) Signing MoU with Regulators in the same manner as done with PSU to give them autonomy in exchange for agreed performance commitments.
(d) Bringing in the concept of Result Framework Document to clearly identify goals.
(e) Setting up a trouble shooting mechanism to handle day to day issues and to avoid conflicts.
Smoothness of democratic polity depends on the efficiency of its institutions. Thus suitable changes should be inculcated as and when necessary to optimise their performance and achieve maximum output.

Rapid Survey on Children (RSOC) report finding
-dealy in publishing 4th round of National Family health survey. release of RSOC has complimented it and credible because its formate is more or less same as NFHS
--Malnutrition and disease due to various factors plagues the children of India, even more severely when compared to the neighbouring countries. The recent RSOC report gave the present status of welfare programs started for reversing such scenario:
--According to it:

1. Although there has been an increase in institutional deliveries, due to Janani Suraksha Yojana. But this has not been accompanied by a parallel breakthrough in maternal care, leading to complications developing during the delivery time.
2. Although initiatives like Pulse Polio, Pentavalent vaccines, Indradhanush, etc. have improved the situation to a large scale, due to the help of various NGOs and ASHA workers(but they are in distress due to lack of incentive and grievance redressal mechanism), but there is still a large scope for increasing their penetration in rural areas for the latter two vaccination drives.
-although there haas been increasae in nutrition level but india is still home to 1/3 malnourished children.
3. Access to safe drinking water: Although it has increased in total volume over the years, but it is not in parallel with the increase in population. Water being a vital component of life, should be available in required quality and quantity to all, to ensure their healthy conditions. To prevent water borne diseases there should be proper water purification plants in cities, alongwith no stagnant water bodies in the locality
-Sanitation - open defecation is practised by around half of population and it says that 40 more years will be required to eradicate that.
4. The cut in initiatives like ICDS and sanitation budget, is also regrettable, which can jeopardise the whole health policy targets of maternal and child health targets


--It is the moral and legal responsibility of the govt to look after the health of the citizens, so as to effectively reap the benefits of the demographic dividend phase.

Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Rurban mission 
--Sept 15 Cabinet has approved the scheme,( announced in budget 2014-15-?)
-will replace  (UPA) government's Provision of Urban Amenities in Rural Areas or PURA initiative, aims at improving the quality of people’s lives by involving the state governments.
-earlier scheme “failed” because only voluntary organisations were involved.There was no government participation in it
-earlier upa scheme was announced at 13 places coudn't take off in 4 and resut of 9 also not good.

New scheme
- Mission aims at development of rural growth clusters which have latent potential for growth, in all States and UTs, which would trigger overall development in the region
-to deliver integrated project based infrastructure in the rural areas. 
-The scheme will also include development of economic activities and skill development. 
-The preferred mode of delivery would be through PPPs while using various scheme funds.
- It is based on the example of Gujarat that has demonstrated successfully the Rurban development model of urbanization of the rural areas, through which people living in the rural areas can get efficient civic infrastructure and associate services.

Critics
-role of PRIs has not been demarcated
-Lack of fund devolution to village level , in many states they still dont have right to levy local taxes and completly dependent on state govt for same
-developing some village and leaving rest could cause resentment.
-Poor agricultural performance in dwindling monsoon times need to be safeguarded and drought mitigation, smart cropping patterns and institutional support in the form of insurance are key for any scheme for rural development and this hasnt been integrated with the SPMRM.


village cluster
-will have 14 mandatory components, including skill development training linked to economic activities, digital literacy, fully equipped mobile health unit, inter-village road connectivity, waste management facilities, and agro-processing units.
- funding for Rurban Clusters will be through various schemes of the government converged into the cluster
-preferred mode of delivery would be through public-private-partnerships
-state governments would identify the clusters in accordance with the framework for implementation prepared by the Ministry of Rural Development.
-separate approach for selection of clusters in tribal and non-tribal districts
-clusters of villages would follow administrative convergence units of Gram Panchayats.
-clusters will also provided citizen service centres - for electronic delivery of citizen centric services and e-gram connectivity, public transport, liquid petroleum gas connections, agri-services including storage and warehousing, sanitation, provision of piped water supply and upgraded education facilities.
