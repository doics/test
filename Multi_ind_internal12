Indardhanush

In the past few years Public Sector Banks (PSBs) have been struggling to deal with - (A) low profitability and (B) high non-performing assets (NPAs). It is against this background that the government seeks to revive PSBs and their performance with Indradhanush. The following are the seven main concerns that Indradhanush seeks to address

(A) Recapitalisation - Infusion of Rs 25,000 crore of capital in debt-laden banks.
(B) Appointments - Keeping in mind global best practices, the post of Chairman and Managing Director are to be seperated and there would be another person who would be appointed as non Executive Chairman of PSBs.
(C) Banks Board Bureau (BBB) - Bank governance the exiting Appointments Board is sought to be replaced by a BBB, which will be tasked with appointment of chairpersons and directors, besides guiding PSBs on matters of strategy.
(D) Governance - Regular Gyan Sangams, i.e., conclave of PSBs and financial institutions has been proposed to discuss the process of governance reforms
(E) Bad loans - NPAs burden of PSBs is sought to be addressed by way of developing vibrant debt markets for PSBs besides strengthening of asset restructuring companies and addressing the issues of stalled projects. 
(F) Empowerment - In this regard, banks have been assured that government will not interfere with their functioning besides allowing them flexibility in hiring manpower. 
(G) Accountability - A new framework - Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) has been proposed to measure the performance of PSBs.

While, the objectives of the Indradhanush initiative appear promising and its proposals welcome, some concerns remain:
(A) Critics argue that periodic bailout are akin to flushing money down the drain. Instead, they propose that recapitalisation must be strictly performance based.
(B) Given that the BBB will continue to have government nominees on board, it is nothing but a rechristened form of the exiting "Appointment Board". BBB could continue to face government interference in matters of appointments resulting in the casualty of merit.
(C) P J Nayak committee's recommendation regarding the setting up of a Bank Investment Company run entirely by professions, to which the government’s equity stakes in PSBs would be transferred, has largely been ignored.
(D) The Nayak Committee proposal on parity of practices between private and public banks has also been ignored.
(E) The measures in relation to NPAs are nothing but a reiteration of the existing measures being taken by the RBI and government in this regard.

Therefore, it appears there is little novelty in the Indradhanush initiative because its proposals are not new and have been "works in progress" for the last few years. However, it is hoped that this initiative works better in comparison to the earlier ones on account of the concerted efforts of all the parties involved.

Ocean Mixing and Monsoons and Air Sea Interactions in the Northern Indian Ocean-Regional Initiative (OMM-ASIRI) project

OMM ASIRI project is a joint collaboration between India and US to study one of the most complex feature of Indian Ocean: Monsoon.

Goal of OMM-ASIRI project:
-> To study and understand formation of cloud over Bay of Bengal
-> To prepare monsoon modelling
-> To access atmosphere of Indian ocean and find its role in weather phenomenon
-> Based on all studies, it wants to develop Monsoon forecasting system

Significance for India:

-> Indian monsoon is lifeline of rural India and thus its assessment will help them
-> Help India to sustain and adapt to climate changes
-> Will lead to new crop system in tandem with monsoon forecast
-> Help Indian Metrological Department to forecast flood, cyclones and related disasters
-> Help Government of India to plan food security and subsidies
-> Enhance mutual learning and technology exchange between India US
->Will lead to boost in R&D development in this field which may help to understand other phenomeanoun

It should be understood that India monsoon and tropical cyclone system are very complex to understand and predict with the existing technologies. Thus it would be for betterment of the mankind in Indian Ocean Region including India, Myanmar, Bangladesh if it can develop better system

Parliament accountability of autonomous institutes.

-Example of controversy b/w RBI and finance ministry good case to understand this.
-to boost eco FM want RBI to cut rates
-But RBI is going slow by keeping a good watch on inflation figure
-to take care of all econim sector imp for these two insti to work in coherent manner.
-Inflation targeting for RBI was a positive step in right direction.
-But more accountablity  should be through parliament than executive to avoid conflict of interest.


there is  lack of coherence between Finance ministry and RBI with both running in opposite direction and thus affecting the national prosperity.
To handle this situation the onus lies on parliament to establish fine balance between accountability and autonomy. It can do so by:
(a) Instituting a separate committee tasked with scrutinising the job of RBI and other regulators and presenting periodic reports to ensure accountability.
(b) Defining clearly the role and responsibilities of various regulator to prevent confusion and intrusion in each other’s domain.
(c) Signing MoU with Regulators in the same manner as done with PSU to give them autonomy in exchange for agreed performance commitments.
(d) Bringing in the concept of Result Framework Document to clearly identify goals.
(e) Setting up a trouble shooting mechanism to handle day to day issues and to avoid conflicts.
Smoothness of democratic polity depends on the efficiency of its institutions. Thus suitable changes should be inculcated as and when necessary to optimise their performance and achieve maximum output.

Rapid Survey on Children (RSOC) report finding
-dealy in publishing 4th round of National Family health survey. release of RSOC has complimented it and credible because its formate is more or less same as NFHS
--Malnutrition and disease due to various factors plagues the children of India, even more severely when compared to the neighbouring countries. The recent RSOC report gave the present status of welfare programs started for reversing such scenario:
--According to it:

1. Although there has been an increase in institutional deliveries, due to Janani Suraksha Yojana. But this has not been accompanied by a parallel breakthrough in maternal care, leading to complications developing during the delivery time.
2. Although initiatives like Pulse Polio, Pentavalent vaccines, Indradhanush, etc. have improved the situation to a large scale, due to the help of various NGOs and ASHA workers(but they are in distress due to lack of incentive and grievance redressal mechanism), but there is still a large scope for increasing their penetration in rural areas for the latter two vaccination drives.
-although there haas been increasae in nutrition level but india is still home to 1/3 malnourished children.
3. Access to safe drinking water: Although it has increased in total volume over the years, but it is not in parallel with the increase in population. Water being a vital component of life, should be available in required quality and quantity to all, to ensure their healthy conditions. To prevent water borne diseases there should be proper water purification plants in cities, alongwith no stagnant water bodies in the locality
-Sanitation - open defecation is practised by around half of population and it says that 40 more years will be required to eradicate that.
4. The cut in initiatives like ICDS and sanitation budget, is also regrettable, which can jeopardise the whole health policy targets of maternal and child health targets


--It is the moral and legal responsibility of the govt to look after the health of the citizens, so as to effectively reap the benefits of the demographic dividend phase.

Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Rurban mission 
--Sept 15 Cabinet has approved the scheme,( announced in budget 2014-15-?)
-will replace  (UPA) government's Provision of Urban Amenities in Rural Areas or PURA initiative, aims at improving the quality of people’s lives by involving the state governments.
-earlier scheme “failed” because only voluntary organisations were involved.There was no government participation in it
-earlier upa scheme was announced at 13 places coudn't take off in 4 and resut of 9 also not good.

New scheme
- Mission aims at development of rural growth clusters which have latent potential for growth, in all States and UTs, which would trigger overall development in the region
-to deliver integrated project based infrastructure in the rural areas. 
-The scheme will also include development of economic activities and skill development. 
-The preferred mode of delivery would be through PPPs while using various scheme funds.
- It is based on the example of Gujarat that has demonstrated successfully the Rurban development model of urbanization of the rural areas, through which people living in the rural areas can get efficient civic infrastructure and associate services.

- 

Critics
-role of PRIs has not been demarcated
-Lack of fund devolution to village level , in many states they still dont have right to levy local taxes and completly dependent on state govt for same
-developing some village and leaving rest could cause resentment.
-Poor agricultural performance in dwindling monsoon times need to be safeguarded and drought mitigation, smart cropping patterns and institutional support in the form of insurance are key for any scheme for rural development and this hasnt been integrated with the SPMRM.


village cluster
-will have 14 mandatory components, including skill development training linked to economic activities, digital literacy, fully equipped mobile health unit, inter-village road connectivity, waste management facilities, and agro-processing units.
- funding for Rurban Clusters will be through various schemes of the government converged into the cluster
-preferred mode of delivery would be through public-private-partnerships
-state governments would identify the clusters in accordance with the framework for implementation prepared by the Ministry of Rural Development.
-separate approach for selection of clusters in tribal and non-tribal districts
-clusters of villages would follow administrative convergence units of Gram Panchayats.
-clusters will also provided citizen service centres - for electronic delivery of citizen centric services and e-gram connectivity, public transport, liquid petroleum gas connections, agri-services including storage and warehousing, sanitation, provision of piped water supply and upgraded education facilities.

Pradhan Mantri Khanij Kshetra Kalyan Yojana

The recently launched Pradhan Mantri Khanij Kshetra Kalyan Yojana (PMKKKY) aims at promoting the welfare of mining project affected areas and communities by making use of the funds in the coffers of the District Mineral Foundation, which was created by a recent amendment to the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act.
-This Scheme mandates for a 30% extra royalty to be given by the mining companies (who have leases under 1957 law ) .which will  channeled into a "District Mineral Foundation".
- royalties in these District Mineral Foundation will be directed majorly towards(60%) the high priority areas such as sanitation, healthcare, pure drinking water, environment conservation etc. 
-Remaining 40% to go into infra development like road,bridge,rail network etc.
 Major benefits of PMKKKY are likely to be:
(A) Address the long standing grievance of the civil society that the poor adivasi communities, despite bearing the brunt of the negative consequences of mining, do not reap any benefits from the same.
(B) Welfare projects undertaken will go a long way in improving the socio-economic conditions of project affected communities and as a consequence bring about a substantial improvement in their in their quality of life.
(C) Help mitigate the adverse environmental impact of mining.
(D) Help provide sustainable livelihood options to the locals, which will help curb the menace of illegal mining.
(E) Help create the necessary physical support and safety infrastructure in rural areas.

However, despite the obvious benefits of PMKKKY, the following are the major limitations to the success of this initiative:
(A) According to DMF rules issued by some states like Odisha, DMFs will be dominated by government officials providing little or no representation of adivasi communities on DMFs.
(B) Will perpetuate the top-down model of development - being the hardest hit by mining projects, the affected communities will have little say regarding the projects that are to be undertaken. 
(C) Initiative lacks any provisions related to independent social audits of projects that are carried out in the name of the affected communities.
(D) Except in scheduled areas, no prior consent of gram sabha is needed prior to taking up programmes under PMKKKY - this effectively sidelines public participation and traditional knowledge, which could have provide crucial inputs.

It is obvious that the developmental benefits of PMKKKY will facilitate the mainstreaming of the people from lower strata of society, tribals and forest-dwellers, provided that the above mentioned concerns are addressed in a time-bound manner.
 
Technology  to reduce subsidy

Benefits
-Will reduce the duplicates beneficiary like happened in PAhal scheme as subsidy burden has been reduced by many thousand crore
-Will remove middleman like in Mnrega , more money go to beneficiary and ghost cards are removed.
-less administrative cost as Technology will be one time setup
-will reduce man power and hence cost , exa : for food subsidy govt transfer differential amount to bank account and then s/he can buy from market - > no seed to have fair price shop


Limitation
- In case if LPG despite introduction of DBT the subsidy is garnered by richer lot. Hence problem of unintended beneficiaries not removed
-Identifying the targeted beneficiary digitally will be very challenging,it was easy in LPG and OMC has consumer data
-Mandatory Adhar striked off by SC so JAM trinity loss it relevance as govt can't make it compulsory to have Adhar so manual chanel has to be there -> more cost to govt
-Fertilizer subsidy is rampant as farmer go for crops with high MSP here no role for technology until govt go for reforms.
-Dependence of agri on Monsoon make our Farmer vulnerable ,govt has to even procure low quality grain to save them from hunger.Change in agri practice is required here rather than technoogy.
-Subsidy losses in food like FCI and example in Air India is more due to operational efficency which need induction of professionalism rather than technology.
- Many undeserving beneficiary take Karosin just to adultrate in Diesel ,


reservation movement by well off caste what it depict
->Social 
-Penchant for govt jobs -  6th pay commission
-feeling of social descrimination -> Reserved cast get selected even with low marks -> frustation
-Increasing penchant toward education/jobs - exa Jats well known for agri but their OBC demands -> they want their child to get education and be at good position

->Economic
Unequal distribution of resources - many people backward even in high cast

->Political
-Used at movment to get political ground - Hardik patel saying that we will see BJP in next state election.
-suppported by some political party


Petrol_diesal_MRP_demand_BY_pumpowner

In current scenario where prices of petrol and diesel get deregulated and crude oil prices are all 

time low the benefits of low crude oil prices are garnered by oil refining and marketing. Retailers 

has to buy fuel at high prices from refiners
and when government cut prices the retailers has to sell it at low prices thereby making losses. The 

spread for dealers is very low and with entry of private sector the profits are eaten by them. 

Therefore dealers are asking for shift towards MRP regime. This will have following benefits for 

consumers:

1. Ceiling will improve efficiency and competition among retailers and consumers will benefitted by 

it because of competitive pricing
2. Low fuel prices will lead to more disposable income in hand of consumers which they can spend in 

whatever way they want
3. More profits to dealers will attract more retailers and leads to increase in number of fuel pumps 

thereby increasing accessibility for consumers.
4. Lowers fuel prices will lead to decrease prices of essential items carried by road transport 

thereby giving a downward push to inflation.

disadvantage
- dealers are few in number and an organised business community so it is very much possible that 

they could make cartel and artificially fix higher prices within the MRP limit
-unethical dealer may restore to dilution to looks attractive by cutting price.
-Global fall in prices may not be proportionately passed on to consumers if dealers keep their 
operational margins high

forest_degraded_open_for_wood_industry_policy

The government has decided to open degraded forest land to commercial lumber, paper pulp and other 

wood based industries provided they have a sustainable development model. Do you think this is a 

right step considering India’s reducing forest cover? Critically comment.


/*Against a policy target of 33% of forest cover, India has a forest cover of only around 23%. But, 

this figure could potentially rise if the proposal to open the degraded land, that consist good 

portion of our forest cover, to wood based industries passes through. Here's how*/
- provide a boost to allied sectors like furniture industry along with job creation.
-Revenue sharing model will be beneficial to govt.
1. Forest industries will have an incentive, under the strict regulations, to protect the forests in 

order to make their livelihood permanent
3. Compensatory afforestation- Any short term net decrease in forest cover, could still be more than 

compensated by planting double/more no of trees at other location 
4. At the same time, Economic benefits will arise from development of these industries. The exports, 

the employment and the income would rise
5. Inclusive Development- The step, if implemented properly, could potentially integrate local 

communities.
-currently import wood from outside which pushes up costs.
-Apart from that used by companies, an estimated ten per cent of the area will be reserved for 

regeneration of trees is good step.

Challenges
-Proper demarcation of degraded land is absent and could enable the industry to encroach into virgin 

forest.
1. Without due regualtory measures, industries could also wipe out the pristine forests
2. lumbering will lead to Monoculture forestry damaging the ecosystem
3.Forests will become fragmented and the housing and the free movements of animals will be hit
4.Could also result in greater man-animal conflicts, as development in Sunderban has shown
-floura and fauna might get impacted.	
-Tribals in the area could be alienated from the area without adequate measures

way forward as Per MOEF minster advice
-Industry should invest much more on R&D 
-Waste management rules,  currently at draft stage, will be notified next month
-Asks industry to resist taking short cuts in the context of implementing environmental norms

The success depends on proper regualtion. With better satellite mapping techniques, use of IT, due 

afforestaion and relocation of fauna, the challenges can be taken care of. And that can result in a 

truly sustainable development: development of man and nature alike

National encryption policy (encryption_policy_draft)
-By Department of Electronics and Information Technology
-Proposed by govt considering the increasing importance of e communication and other online activies
-Draft version  was put for public feedback
-Aim to create an environment of secure cyber space and to strengthened cyber laws of the country

Proposal
-User Need to save the plain text of cyber communication for 90 days and should be able to reproduce 

if asked by authority
-Applicable to online services which use any form of encryption.
-All the credentials , encryption algorithm can be asked if required
-covered messages ,email services website including whatsapp , weChat, Gmail ,yahoo etc.

Criticism
-against FR  [against basic Human rights]
-draft  in contrast to the objectives of the IT Act.
-Comman junta dont understand encryption it is done by application and user dont have any control on 

that. [against basic human right as eill force to have understanding of encryption to comply the 

law]
-will discourage startup and hence compitition  -> user have to pay more (against basic human 

rights)
-will restrict user choices of what to do or delete and what not to do or delete (against basic 

human rights) 
-Go totally against ground reality as user will find it annoying to keep info for 90 days. it will 

almost criminalize all internet users.
-security concern : the service providers, e-commerce companies that uses encrypted keys to secure 

their websites is required to produce these codes and encryption algo when asked by the government. 

this will make sensitive info accessible to hacker and compromise on user privacy (against basic 

human right)
-Registration of service providers:
it is being mooted that the online services, be it shopping online or accessing email, has to 

register with the government which is
biggest impediment to the net neutrality and impede the growth of nascent companies.will also create 

bureaucratic hurdles and effect ease of doing business.

intention is good but implementation seems faulty.
