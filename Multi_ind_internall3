Smoking/Tambacoo related
-smokers more prone to detah supported by below facts
1.inhaling smoke impairs lungs; causing a pre-disposition
towards respiratory illnesses & allergies.
2. clinical studies prove that habitual smoking enhances
risk of lung cancer; a fatal condition.
3. nicotine in smoke causes blood vessels to tighten,
restricting the blood flow; damaging the cardio-vascular system.
4.smoking suppresses appetite via hormonal changes; so
body is devoid of essential nutrients.
5.Infact passive smoking enhances the risk towards stroke, coronary heart
diseases and heart attack.

Indian commitment to discourage smoking habit can be seen through:
1.international conventions: India is a signatory to UN
framework Convention on Tobacco Control which prohibits the sale of cigarettes
individually or in small packets as it increases the affordability; through suitable
regulations India will have to implement this anti-tobacco convention.
2. taxation: on tobacco products has been enhanced steeply.
3. public smoking: has been banned.
4. pictorial warnings: are mandatory on cigarette packets;
smoking scenes carry warnings.
criticism: proposal to ensure 85% pictorial warnings on cigarette packets has
been mired in controversies; consensus over the issue seems to elude the
political executive.

Shah bano case [from MP]
-Muslim women with 5 kids was divorced by her husband
-He denied her monthly maintenance fee after giving her permanent divorce
-Saying she is not a liability to him anymore
-Women approached local court which directed husband for monthly payment
-amount was further increased by MP HC 
-Husband moves to SC stating that since he has given permanent talaq so not liable
-SC invoked section 125  of CRPC and state, applicable to each irrespective of cast or creed
and asked him to pay monthly maintenance
-Muslim protested against judgement saying it infringe on Muslim personal law.
-Rajiv GAndi govt in 1986 enacted a law to dillute SC judgement
-Muslim women(Protection of Rights on Divorce) act -1986
-On giving divorce husband has to give maintennace during iddat period of 90 days.
- led to Muslim women receiving a large, one-time payment from husband during iddat period
-instead of a maximum monthly payment of INR500 - an upper limit which has since been removed
-Challenged by Danial Latifi & Anr v. Union Of India as DAnial was shah bano lawyer
-Court reiterated the validity of the Shah Bano judgment. It extends for the 
entire life of the divorced wife until she remarries
The Muslim Personal Law Board quesitoned SC validity to interpreate religious text.

implications
-upheld the rights of muslim womens as pert of CRPC act
-uphold validity of our constitution which says no desrimination based on religion/gender
-In fact, it triggered introspection in many other personal laws.
-said case highlighted the need for the enactment of the Uniform Civil Code, as propounded under A. 44 of the Constitution.
-judgement was concerned with the rights of muslim women in particular, it strengthen women's movements of all hues fighting for justice and equality.
-definitely mainstreamed the discourse on the pitiful condition of Indian women. Maintenance is the tip of the iceberg for there remain many other provision in the statute books, which discriminate against women. 
-The subsequent ruling of the SC in Daniel Latifi which harmoniously constructed muslim women's right to maintenance under CrPC and Sharia, drew strength from the observations of the Court in Shah Bano
cons
-On the flipside, the Shah Bano judgment gave impetus to the forces of communalism in India.subsequent law by govt seen as appeasment politics by majority.

RTI in security agencies
-Section 24 of RTI act excempt 25 security forces and agency to 
give information under RTI
to protect whistle blowers and stop leak of these info
-but they have to give information if matter related to corruption 
and human right violations
-They have to designate an public information officer who will send 
info to centre information officer about the no of RTI received data etc.
-high rejection rate
-in 2010 a petitioner requestes for info on corruptio and human right 
violation in IB , raw,
BSF and other security org but only info on assam riffle was given

Some of the issues with its implementation of RTI are :
1) The CIC has not been appointed since an year. This has resulted in pending of cases and more importantly shows the complete disregard to the institution and the act.
2) Infrastructure provided to Information commissioner-ate is inadequate. It results in delay in processing application and penalising authorities. 
3) Political parties have still not replied to the CIC orders. More so, they have not even initiated a legal response to the orders. This shows utmost disregard.
4) State governments such as Karnataka have come up with orders reducing the word limit, making formats for question and in some cases prohibited questions in regional languages.
5) Penalities are rarely imposed and even that is too minimal. Having no inventive on the officials to provide information.
6) Data in government departments is not kept, not organised and this makes getting information difficult.
7) Government have misused provisions related to secrecy and national security to become immune to RTI applications.
8)Some department seeks more money to give information which shouldn't be seeked as per RTI act.
+ve

-info used by NGO/think tanks ot access goverment work and progress
-media also played a crucial role to unearthen many abnormality.

National Highway Development project
-Road infra very important as it carries most of the traffic.
- "National Highways" account for only about 2% of the total length of roads
, but carry about 40% of the total traffic
-National highway development (NHDP) project was one of the massive projects undertaken 
by the government of that time. Since 2001 it is being implemented in 7 phases by National 
highway authority of India (NHAI).
Taking about performance of the project it was quite successful in its first and second phase 
compared to other phases.
Ist and 2nd phase - During this time the major achievements of the project was construction of 
golden quadrilateral(1st -fully completed) and NSEW (North – South – East- West )[2nd phase] Corridor.
 It connects India from one extreme to other. Apart from that 4/6 laning of around 14000 km roads were completed.
3rd phase -  national highways on a Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) basis,connecting state capitals and
area of economic importance.4 laning
4th phase- onvert existing single lane highways into two lanes with paved shoulders
phase 5- four lane highways will need to be upgraded/expanded to six lanes.
phase 6- on constructing expressways that would connect major commercial and industrial township
phase 7-  improvements to city road networks by adding ring roads to enable easier connectivity with national
 highways to important cities.and improvement in NH requiring flyovers and bypass.
3rd to 5th phase- As compared to 1st and 2nd phase the work completed was not considerable. 
Mostly 4-6 laning of National highway were completed and up gradation of highways connecting cities 
were done. It was not comparable to the Golden quadrilateral and NSEW corridor project work that we brag about.
6th and 7th phase. – Major works completed in this period was construction of 1000 km of new expressways
 with all modern facilities.
Other small stand alone structures like bridge, flyovers, tunnels and bypasses were constructed at that time
critical part::
- corruption,sub contracting, tardiness, toll tax issue, ppp model problems
