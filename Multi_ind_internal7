Indira Gandhi Matritva Sahyog Yojna
(IGMS) - @2010 to give a push toward achieving Millenium Development Goal 
under this scheme:
1)partial wage compensation to pregnant and lactating women in order to promote rest and healthy feeding practices
2)increase utilisation of healthcare services
3) Cash incentives are given.
4)Except women in govt sector , esp target women in unorganised  sector.
The scheme is conditional on timely registration, complete vaccination, attending counselling sessions and 
exclusive breastfeeding of the child.
But the implementation of scheme is very bad due to:
1) Lack of awareness among beneficiaries
2) Lack of budget allocation by government
3) Leakages 
4)Difficult conditions: cash is only deposited into an account. Opening and accessing accounts is 
often expensive and time consuming because banks and post offices are often far from villages
5)State and district implementation cells missing in most of the states.
6) No grievieance addressal system


ICDS -NOTED

-Funds cut from 18k crore to 8K crore
launched with main objective of raising health and nutritional level of child below 6 
-to raise nutrition level in kids and preparing a healthy base for overall development.

-All india services
IAS/IPS/IFS
-Sardar patel called father of IPS
-A312

-Differentation b/w various services
-IAS officers are believed to be holding most of the posts in the Central Staffing Scheme, which provides the pool of officers for senior posts in the Central government
-generalist IAS holds nearly 90 per cent of the posts of joint secretary and above even at post requiring domain expertise like chief vigilance officers, and investigative agencies.
-2/3 of IPS are provided to states through IPS. issue of confrontation as state govt prefer promoting their own officers from state police to sensitive position
-reason could be caste calculations , vote bank,regional consideration etc.

IAS problems
-Politiacal influence and intervention. major regig in portfolios and transfers when new got takes charge
-lack of officers as many vacancies are still empty.Less than 20% are female officers.
-frequent transfers as it is under control of state govt.
-diverse portfolio of working so they can't focus on particular area and develope expertise
-Salary don't compliment the amount of work and preseeure.
-A 311 protection from prosecution is under question due to some act of corruption and dishonesty by some officers
-Problems of egos, fight for promotions etc are causing disruption in governance and increase in petitions to tribunals like CAT
-force to do wrong under political pressure like in Haryana JBT scam it came to known that officers were put under pressure to sign on unethical orders.

SC orders [Nov 2013]
-to constitute civil services board to curb unnencessary transfers and give 3 yr fixed tenure.
-CSB, consisting of high ranking service officers, who are experts in their respective fields, with the Cabinet Secretary at the Centre and Chief Secretary at the State level.
- management of transfers, postings, inquiries, process of promotion, reward, punishment and disciplinary matters

-SC held that(May 14) Section 6A of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, which granted protection(coz central govt permission required) to joint secretary and above officers from facing even a preliminary inquiry by the CBI in corruption cases, was violative of Article 14.



Higher Education 
 In the last 10 years, there has been a massive ad hoc expansion of Central Universities, IITs 
 and Indian Institutes of Management resulting in a shortage of faculty by 40 to 50 per cent
- introduction of the mechanical Academic Performance Indicator (API)-based recruitment and 
promotions. Rather than ensuring quality, this move has led to the emergence of poor quality journals,
Govt planning:
council of the vice-chancellors of the Central Universities, with the Minister of HRD heading it,
 has been proposed. In addition, all the Central Universities are to be brought under a common Act,
 there is to be a common curriculum, a teacherâ€™s recruitment board, transferability of students
 among these universities and so on
-Good faculty are reluctant to join newer institutions as they lack infrastructure and because many 
of them are in remote areas.If transfer rule happen if good faculty transferred to weak institute it 
can demoralize them.
-In an authoritarian system, this can be used to punish teachers by posting them to remote areas
Sending weak academics to good institutions could result in a deterioration of quality
-this might be +Ve and -ver on autonomy of institution
For good teaching quality of higher edu
-More focus on practical
-Need to strengthen accreditation agencies so that ill planned institute are put out in screening.
-Free from plitical interference
-Collaboration with foreign university
-Clubbing modern science with traditional knowledge can generate a buzz
-incentive to recruit best tailent
-Creationg of good infra.
-Promote open online course
-incentive for good performing teachers to retain talent.
-flexible policy to recruit foreign teachers 
-Currently R&D buget is too small
-R&D in collaboration with Industry  like in Korea and Germany.
-Industry apprentice for students to make it interested for them.
-Estab University Data base to frame better policy.
=Reasons for Politicial influence
1)Financial dependency 2) Administration dependency 3)Association of political parties with 
major studen wings like ABVP. 4)LAck of independent regulatory authority 5) Control of 
government over UGC which fund all the central university and accreditation  is not 
transparent so political influence on decisions.
6)Ideological diff of political parties push to influence the history , curriculam
7)Lack of accountability and efficent in higher edu hierarchy make it porous for political
 intervention.
Example : DU Four year graduation program scrapping , quitting of IIT director etc

Handloom (Reservation of Articles for Production) Act, 1985.
-started as a measure to protect the traditional handloom sector from powerlooms and mechanised sector
-provide reservation of certain articles to be manufactured by handlooms only
-extend to whole terittory of India

-Central Assistance is also given to state governments to set up an Enforcement Machinery in the state to ensure that there is no violation of the handlooms act.
->govt is planning to remove this -> consequences
-repealing will result in the unemployment of a large section
-symbol of our heritage and the repeal will make it prone to be lost forever
- People are more attracted towards the original handloom produced garments,as these have quality which can't be achieved in powerloom which also reaps a large revenue for the govt, which will be lost on its repeal.
-has low carbon footprints
-Rural self seficiency, and impact on Cottage and Small scale industry
-some traditional indian hallmark product life banarasi saree ,Kashmiri shawl may be lost.
+Ve side
-will increase compitition so price will come down
-may increase the export capacity by improving operational efficenty
-may bring forieign investment in clothing.
-Labours in it are generally unorganized, which in powerloom big industries will get more security.

It cant be denied that powerloom provides economy of scale which is critical in free trade era, at the same time the employment of handloom workers and the preservation of traditional art cant be jeoprodized.
-so govt may take middle path by ensuring typical hallmark area like banarasi saree are not impacted.

Ganga cleaning
-A river is considered polluted when the bio chemical oxygen demand (BOD) risse above 2mg/l .CPCB report says around 2300 km(including tributaries) of ganga rive is polluted

importance of Ganga
-largest river basin covering 11 state ,23% of country landmass and 43% of population.

->source of pollution
-main source of pollution in river water are municipal sewage (75%) and industrial pollution (25%)
-other are agri run off, open defecation, medical waste, dead body cremation.
->earlier schems
-around 6850 crore spent by center and state together in 30 yr from 1985 to March 2015 under earler schemes like
Ganga action plan, National River conservation plan.[NRCP]
-1985 nrcp was 50,50 then became 100% in 1997 and then 70-30 in 2001
-UPA formed National Ganga River basin authority focussing on basin specific approach.But no visible results


New scheme
-Namami Gange
-intention to ramp up progress of ganga clean up mission
-20k crore allocated by govt while approved by cabinet in May 15 apart from 2037 crore allocated in 14-15 budget
-100% centrallized funded
-Will focus on Ganga and all of its tributory Ganga,Yamuna,Gomti etc
-Will cover 47 town and 12 rivers in 8 states
- 1632 gram panchayat around ganga to be made open defecation free by 2022.
unlike earlier schems will involve local people ,gram panchayat and municipal org.
Proposed measures
-4 Battalion of Ganga Eco task force to implent strictly
-interception diversion and treatment of waste water in drains , in-situ treatment.
-immediate measures to arrest inflow of sewage
-PPP/SPV approach for pollution hotspot
-STP and effluent treatment plant.

National policy on Education -NOTED
-promote an education system which is secular, scientific and progressive
-National system of education will be based on national curricular framework
-which will be designed to promote values of India's common cultural heritage, 
egalitarianism, democracy and secularism
-All educational programmes will be carried on in strict conformity with secular values.
-if one introduces Shlokas of Bhagavadgita they must also include verses from religious 
texts of Jainism, Buddhism, Islam, Christianity etc.
-nothing wrong in introducing religious teachings in school. What is important is their purpose and form
- purpose should be to imbibe only ethical values[no ideology building] and form 
should be secular[no particular religion taking centre stage]
-government can introduce a subject like Value education as ICSE schools have done


Choice based credit system (CBCS)
 -pattern of higher education in India is rigid, don't offer flexibility to choose
 available courses
 -CBCS aims to make higher education more student centric; aims to provide choice  
 within an institution as well as "seamless mobility across institutions" in India 
 and abroad by adopting a "cafeteria approach".
merits:
-flexibility: can choose their courses as per their needs &aspirations.
-holistic education: is encouraged as system has an interdisciplinary approach 
to learning. 
-mobility: CBCS brings uniform examination system throughout the country; 
making grades/
credits portable allowing students to transfer university with course midway also
-foreign universities: will become more familiar with our higher education;
de-merits: 
-does not recognizes the radical differences between "standard"
in different colleges & universities. 
-uniform structure of syllabi for all universities;
hamper institute's autonomy.
-a uniform curriculum will ensure that research expertise
of institute's teacher will be overlooked; system may lead to uniform
mediocrity.
it appears CBCS is being implemented in a haste; instead proper consensus
should be arrived at after discussions with all stakeholders; any new system
should take into account expertise of individual institutes along with evolving
a uniformity in higher education.
