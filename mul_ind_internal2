Revised national TB(tuberculosis) control program [RNTCP]
- WHO 2014 report says: India have already met its MDG goal by 50% reduction in TB cases prevalent in 1990. But to eliminate TB by 2050 the reduction rate should be 18-19% but it is only 2-3%.
-state-run tuberculosis control initiative of the Government of India.
-RNTCP incorporates the principles of directly observed treatment-shortcourse (DOTS).
DOTS is a systematic strategy which has five components:
-->Political and administrative commitment:Since TB can be cured and the epidemic reversed, it warrants the topmost priority, which has been accorded by the Government of India.
-->Good quality diagnosis:Good quality microscopy allows health workers to see the tubercle bacilli and diagnose properly.
-->Good quality drugs :An uninterrupted supply of good quality anti-TB drugs must be available.RNTCP provides a box of medication for the entire treatment for every person registered.
-->Supervised treatment to ensure the right treatment:The RNTCP uses the best anti-TB medications available in a right way.
-->Systematic monitoring and accountability:Standard recording and reporting system, and the technique of ‘cohort analysis’ are used to keep an account of every person treated.
The second phase on RNTCP which includes DOTS expansion and enhancement,addressing TB-HIV, MDR-TB and other challenges,contribution to health system strengthening,involvement of all health care providers,engaging people with TB, and affected communities and involving in research have strengthened the program and have contibuted towards eradication of TB.
The program thus provides, free of cost, quality anti-tubercular drugs across the 
country through the numerous Primary Health Centres and the growing number of private-sector DOTS-providers and thus benefiting the common man.
critical analysis
- RNTCP currently treats patients without knowing their resistance profile,
-private treatement go unnoticed. need to develop e-Nikshay, an advanced version to the existing Nikshay system for notifying TB patients. & increase surveillance

TADA and POTA failed experiment
-Terror and disruptive activities (Prevention) Act came during punjab insurgency and 
POTA after parliament attack.
-Both tried to address deteriorating internal security by giving power to state agency.
Reason for failure
-Too draconian ->allow confession in custody as proof in court ->encourage custodial torture
-enabled state agencies to sidestep rigorous investigation , elongated stay in jail.
TADA 1 yr without charge sheet and 6 months for POTA
-TADA curbed free speech strict sedition provision for anti state view.
-evoked by state agencies in an arbitrary manner,many cases accused find innocent in court.
-Give invincibility to police , encourage them to act irresponsibly
-Were misused for political Vedanta.,Tamil politician arrested under POTA
-VIAKO arrested by TN govt on account of supporting LTTE
-Surat twin blast case, persons convicted were in jail for around 20 years later SC
found them innocent
-SC also observed misuse during Akshardham terror attack case.

Surrogacy
-n October 2008, the Supreme Court unequivocally ruled that “commercial surrogacy is legal and an industry in India.making it a legally protected

-After initially banning surrogacy in 2012, the govt introduced Assisted Reproductive Technologies Act in 2013, which proposes strict guidelines for the foreign couple, as well as securing the well being of the surrogates.currently being regulated as per ICMR(indian council of medical researce) guidelines as  below:
- Accreditation, Supervision and Regulation of Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) Clinics.
-Surrogacy arrangement will continue to be governed by contract amongst parties, which will contain all the terms requiring consent of surrogate mother to bear child, agreement of her husband and other family members for the same, medical procedures of artificial insemination, reimbursement of all reasonable expenses for carrying child to full term, willingness to hand over the child born to the commissioning parent(s), etc. But such an arrangement should not be for commercial purposes.
-A surrogacy arrangement should provide for financial support for surrogate child in the event of death of the commissioning couple or individual before delivery of the child, or divorce between the intended parents and subsequent willingness of none to take delivery of the child.
-A surrogacy contract should necessarily take care of life insurance cover for surrogate mother.
-One of the intended parents should be a donor as well so that children have biological love bond.
-Legislation itself should recognize a surrogate child to be the legitimate child of the -commissioning parent(s) without there being any need for adoption or even declaration of guardian.
The birth certificate of the surrogate child should contain the name(s) of the commissioning parent(s) only.
-Right to privacy of donor as well as surrogate mother should be protected.
-Sex-selective surrogacy should be prohibited.
-Cases of abortions should be governed by the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act 1971 only.
->Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) (ART) Bill in 2013
-restricting surrogacy to “infertile Indian married couples only not to foreigners(untill married to indian citizens)
-(NRIs), persons of Indian origin (PIOs) and overseas citizens of India (OCIs) be eligible for
surrogacy in India

why low efficeny of regulations
-- low efficacy, as the prospective surrogates can be taken to some other country, with lesser stringent rules.
--The solution can only be attained when we give an alternate avenue of financial security to such women

Street vendor act 2014
-government aimed to balance three key objectives - Protecting the livelihoods of the vendors, ensuring congestion free public spaces and streets and ensuring the convenience of vending services for the consumers
-Act aims at ensuring a uniform legal framework to protect the livelihood of street vendor
-aimed to divide the market into vending and non vending zones, and to provide vending certificates to all the vendors so that they can freely carry on their occupation in a regulated way at permitted areas 
->Provisions
- Formation of the Town Vending Committee with at least 40% representation of street vendors with 1/3 as women
-The act specifies that no vendor can be evicted without a 7 day notice by the local authority.also a separate vending location for vendor
-f this act is implemented effectively, it will stop illegal hafta earning of police, municipal authority



->Drawbacks-leaves major areas of regulation to the street vending scheme to be formulated by the state governments
-TVC initiation is to be done by MC so sometime they delibrate delay it.
-Municipality commisioner is head of TVC so MC has greater control over it
-in the creation of the street vending plan or in dispute redressal mechanism, the TVC has no role
- role of TVCs has been reduced to specifying time limits for issue and renewal of registration and vending certificate
-this law supercedes the laws enacted by states like Rajasthan and Gujarat which provided significant powers to the TVCs


First Socio Economic Caste census (SECC)
-findings of the census are similar to that of the Rangarajan committee, setup  in 2012.which said poor in 2011-12 was 30.95 in rural areas and 26.4 in urban areas.
-takes caste into account for the first time in any such exercise since 1934, covered 24.39 crore households
-Information was collected on a range of parameters at the individual and household levels like occupation, education, disability, religion, SC/ST status, name of caste/tribe, employment, income and source of income, assets, housing, possession of consumer durables and non durables and land owned. 
-on rural households, the census was distributed across three categories: those that have to be compulsorily excluded; those that have to be compulsorily included; and those that fall in-between – they were then ranked based on seven deprivation criteria 
-households in which the main earner has an uncertain income source and who live in kutcha houses will be BPL 
-Auto included households without shelter, destitute living on alms, manual scavengers, primitive tribal groups and legally released bonded labourers. 
-Auto excluded from poor in rural :motorised vehicles, mechanised agricultural equipment, Kisan credit card with credit limit of Rs 50,000 and above. any family member earning more than Rs 10,000 a month, those paying income/professional tax, living in houses with three or more rooms with all having pucca walls and roof, owning a refrigerator, landline phone, possessing irrigated land

->findings
-Nearly one in every three rural households still have an uncertain source of income and continue to live in one-room kutcha houses
-Of the rural households covered, 21.53 per cent belonged to scheduled castes and tribes 
-31.26 percent has been officially pegged as the outer limit of poor in rural areas.But people falling under BPL due to inflation will stay out of bpl band is cause of concern.
-MP is the poorest state in terms of less than 5k income a month with one kutchha house per household followed by chattisgarh and bihar
- in rural area 30pc of the people are landless and unemployed 
-Majority of the rural people ie 50.7pc undertake medication from the private hospitals in contrast to meager 18pc in the govt hospitals and primary health centers.data identical for urban
-urban infra in nearly 20 lakhs household still dont have access to electricity and water sealed toilets
-50 lakh households have drinking water away from the premises.
-The data shows around 23.5% illiteracy among adults in rural areas and increased expenditure on education

Smoking/Tambacoo related
-smokers more prone to detah supported by below facts
1.inhaling smoke impairs lungs; causing a pre-disposition
towards respiratory illnesses & allergies.
2. clinical studies prove that habitual smoking enhances
risk of lung cancer; a fatal condition.
3. nicotine in smoke causes blood vessels to tighten,
restricting the blood flow; damaging the cardio-vascular system.
4.smoking suppresses appetite via hormonal changes; so
body is devoid of essential nutrients.
5.Infact passive smoking enhances the risk towards stroke, coronary heart
diseases and heart attack.

Indian commitment to discourage smoking habit can be seen through:
1.international conventions: India is a signatory to UN
framework Convention on Tobacco Control which prohibits the sale of cigarettes
individually or in small packets as it increases the affordability; through suitable
regulations India will have to implement this anti-tobacco convention.
2. taxation: on tobacco products has been enhanced steeply.
3. public smoking: has been banned.
4. pictorial warnings: are mandatory on cigarette packets;
smoking scenes carry warnings.
criticism: proposal to ensure 85% pictorial warnings on cigarette packets has
been mired in controversies; consensus over the issue seems to elude the
political executive.
